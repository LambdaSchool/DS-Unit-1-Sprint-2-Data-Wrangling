SecureDrop is an Open Source whistleblower system which is deployed over 75 news organizations all over the world. Our threat model has nation state actors as possible threats, so, security and privacy of the users of the system is a very important point of the whole project. The tools in this case are build and packaged into reproducible Debian deb packages and are installed on Qubes OS in the final end user systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two basic ways we handle Python project dependencies, for most of the development work, we use a virtualenv, and directly install the dependencies using wheels built from pypi.org. When we package the application for the end users, many times we package them using a operating system based package manager and ask the users to install using those (say RPM or Debian&#39;s deb package). In the second case, all the dependencies come as separate packages (and most of the time from the OS itself). The dependency is being handled by the OS package manager itself. That case, we can not update the dependencies fast enough if required, it depends on the packagers from the community who maintains those said packages in the distribution.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe use [dh-virtualenv](https://dh-virtualenv.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/) project to help us to use our own wheels + a virtualenv for the project to be packaged inside the debian .deb package.\\r\\nThis talk will go throuh [the process](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client) of building wheels from known (based on sha256sum) source tarballs, and then having a gpg signed list of updated wheels and [a private index](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-debian-packaging/tree/master/simple) for the same.

CPU performance is plateauing, but GPUs provide a chance for continued hardware performance gains, if you can structure your programs to make good use of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nCUDA is a platform developed by Nvidia for GPGPU--general purpose computing with GPUs. It backs some of the most popular deep learning libraries, like Tensorflow and Pytorch, but has broader uses in data analysis, data science, and machine learning. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several ways that you can start taking advantage of CUDA in your Python programs. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor some common Python libraries, there are drop-in replacements that let you start running computations on the GPU while still using familiar APIs. For example, CuPy provides a NumPy-like API for interacting with multi-dimensional arrays. Similarly, cuDF is a recent project that mimics the pandas interface for dataframes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want more control over your use of CUDA APIs, you can use the PyCUDA library, which provides bindings for the CUDA API that you can call from your Python code. Compared with drop-in libraries, it gives you the ability to manually allocate memory on the GPU, and write custom CUDA functions (called kernels). However, its drawbacks include writing your CUDA code as large strings in Python, and compiling your CUDA code at runtime.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, for the best performance you can use the Python C/C++ extension interface, the approach taken by deep learning libraries like Pytorch. One of the strengths of Python is the ability to drop down into C/C++, and libraries like NumPy take advantage of this for increased speed. If you use Nvidia’s nvcc compiler for CUDA, you can use the same extension interface to write custom CUDA kernels, and then call them from your Python code.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis talk will explore each of these methods, provide examples to get started, and discuss in more detail the pros and cons of each approach. </div>\\n  \\n    <h2>\\n      <a id=\"presentation-184\"\\n         href=\"/2019/schedule/presentation/184/\">\\n        Dependency hell: a library author&#39;s guide\\n      </a>\\n    </h2>\\n    <p>\\n      <b>\\n        Yanhui Li, Brian Quinlan\\n        \\n      </b>\\n      \\n      <br>\\n      <b>\\n        Saturday\\n        11:30 a.m.&ndash;noon\\n        in\\n        Grand Ballroom B\\n      </b>\\n      \\n    </p>\\n    <div class=\"presentation-description\"\\n         >Python is known for its &quot;batteries included&quot; philosophy but no Python developer can live without the language&#39;s rich library ecosystem.

Set operations enable simpler and faster solutions for many tasks;\\r\\n1. Python&#39;s set classes are lessons in elegant, idiomatic API design;\\r\\n1. A set class is a suitable context for implementing operator overloading.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoolean logic and set theory are closely related. In practice, we will see cases where set operations provide simple and fast declarative solutions to programming problems that otherwise require complicated and slow procedural coding.\\r\\n\\r\\nPython&#39;s set built-ins and ABCs provide a rich and well designed API. We will consider their interfaces, and how they can inspire the creation of Pythonic APIs for your own classes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, we will discuss operator overloading — a technique that is not suitable everywhere, but certainly makes sense with sets. Taking a few operators as examples, we will study their implementation in a new `UintSet` class for integer elements. `UintSet` fully implements the `MutableSet` interface over a totally different internal representation based on a bit array instead of a hash table. Membership tests run in _O(1)_ time like the built-in sets (however, `UintSet` is currently pure Python, so YMMV). Using bit arrays allow core set operations like intersection and union to be implemented with fast bitwise operators, and provides compact storage for dense sets of integers.\\r\\n</div>\\n  \\n    <h2>\\n      <a id=\"presentation-197\"\\n         href=\"/2019/schedule/presentation/197/\">\\n        Statistical Profiling (and other fun with the sys module)\\n      </a>\\n    </h2>\\n    <p>\\n      <b>\\n        Emin Martinian\\n        \\n      </b>\\n      \\n      <br>\\n      <b>\\n        Saturday\\n        2:35 p.m.&ndash;3:05 p.m.\\n        in\\n        Atrium Ballroom AB\\n      </b>\\n      \\n    </p>\\n    <div class=\"presentation-description\"\\n         >Profiling involves computing a set of data about how often and how\\r\\nlong various parts of your program are executed.

This means that modifying the behavior of a superclass might alter the behavior of all its subclasses, sometimes in unanticipated ways. Furthermore, it’s commonly accepted that inheritance actually breaks encapsulation. So, if inheritance has these issues, what alternative do we have? More than two decades ago, The Gang of Four (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides) suggested in their famous _Design Patterns_ book  that we should favor object composition over class inheritance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this talk I will show some code examples in Python where inheritance goes astray and demonstrate how to correct them by using composition.

There are time zones that switch to [DST twice per year](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/morocco/casablanca). But not necessarily every year.  In Python it&#39;s even possible to create datetimes with non-transitive equality (`a == b`, `b == c`, `a != c`).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this talk you&#39;ll learn about Python&#39;s time zone model and other concepts critical to avoiding datetime troubles. Using `dateutil` and `pytz` as examples, this talk covers how to deal with ambiguous and imaginary times, datetime arithmetic around a Daylight Savings Time transition, and datetime&#39;s new `fold` attribute, introduced in Python 3.6 ([PEP 495](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0495/)).\\r\\n</div>\\n  \\n  \\n</div>\\n                  \\n                </div>\\n              </div>\\n            </div>\\n            \\n          </div>\\n        \\n    </div>\\n  \\n</div>\\n<footer>\\n  <div class=\"footer-container\">\\n    <img class=\"python-logo\" src=\"/2019/site_media/static/img/psf-logo.3411e5f40050.png\"\\n         width=300 alt=\"PSF logo\">\\n    \\n    <p>\\n      The PyCon 2019 conference in Cleveland, Ohio, USA, is a production of the\\n      <a href=\"http://python.org/psf/\">Python Software Foundation</a>.\\n      This site is built using\\n      <a href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/\">Django</a>\\n      and\\n      <a href=\"http://eldarion.com/symposion/\" title=\"Symposion — An Open Platform for Conference Websites\">Symposion</a>.\\n      Hosting is provided by\\n      <a href=\"http://heroku.com/\">Heroku</a>.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Logo and Branding by\\n      <a href=\"http://hellofizz.com/\"><img title=\"Fizz Creative\" alt=\"Fizz Creative\" src=\"/2019/site_media/static/img/fizz.b1afc5c95fa1.png\"/></a>.\\n    </p>\\n  </div>\\n</footer>\\n\\n\\n\\n</body>\\n</html>\\n'"
