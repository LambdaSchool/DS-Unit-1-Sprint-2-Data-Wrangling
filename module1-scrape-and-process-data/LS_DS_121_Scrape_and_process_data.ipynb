No security background knowledge is required. The talk assumes at least intermediate Python experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeâ\\x80\\x99ll take a tour of real side channel vulnerabilities in open source Python codebases, including the patches that fixed them.

But recently Iâ\\x80\\x99ve come to appreciate just how easy it is to calculate this statistic incorrectly. We learn once - in middle school no less - how to take an average, and never revisit it. Then, when we are faced with multidimensional datasets (ie. pretty much every dataset out there), we never reconsider whether we should be taking an average the same way.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this talk, we follow my arduous and humbling journey of learning how to properly take an average with multidimensional data. We will cover how improperly calculating it can produce grossly incorrect figures, which can slip into publications, research analyses and management reports.', 'Recommender systems have become increasingly popular in recent years, and are used by some of the largest websites in the world to predict the likelihood of a user taking an action on an item.

On top of the general design, there are many code quality aspects that you need to watch out for when writing and reviewing code such as adherence to PEP8, docstring quality, test quality, etc. Furthermore, everyone is human. If you are catching these code quality issues by hand, there is a good chance that at some point you will miss an easy opportunity to improve code quality. If the quality check can be done by a machine, then why would you even try to catch the code quality issue by hand? In the end, the machine will be able to perform the quality check with much more speed, accuracy, and consistency than a person.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis talk will dive into how existing open source projects offload and automate many of these code quality checks resulting in:\\r\\n\\r\\n- A higher quality and a more consistent codebase\\r\\n- Maintainers being able to focus more on the higher level design and interfaces\\r\\n  of a project.\\r\\n- An improved contribution process and higher quality pull requests from\\r\\n  external contributors\\r\\n\\r\\nBy diving into how these open source projects automate code quality checks, you will learn about:\\r\\n\\r\\n- The available tooling related to checking code quality such as `flake8`,\\r\\n  `pylint`, `coverage`, etc.\\r\\n- How to automate code quality checks for both a development and team \\r\\n  setting.\\r\\n- First-hand accounts of the benefits and lessons learned from automating\\r\\n  code quality checks in real-life open source projects.', 'Nowadays, there are many ways of building data science models using Python, including statistical and machine learning methods. I will introduce probabilistic models, which use Bayesian statistical methods to quantify all aspects of uncertainty relevant to your problem, and provide inferences in simple, interpretable terms using probabilities.  A particularly flexible form of probabilistic models uses Bayesian *non-parametric* methods, which allow models to vary in complexity depending on how much data are available. In doing so, they avoid the over-fitting that is common in machine learning and statistical modeling. I will demonstrate the basics of Bayesian non-parametric modeling in Python, using the PyMC3 package. Specifically, I will introduce two common types, Gaussian processes and Dirichlet processes, and show how they can be applied easily to real-world problems using two examples.', 'Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is gaining popularity as an improved way to collaborate over product features and tests. In Python, **behave** is one of the leading BDD test frameworks. Using **behave**, teams write Gherkin behavior scenarios (e.g., tests) in plain language, and then programmers write Python code to automate the steps. BDD testing is great because tests are self-documenting and steps abide by the DRY principle. An example test could be:\\r\\n\\r\\n> Given the DuckDuckGo home page is displayed\\r\\n> When the user searches the phrase \"Python\"\\r\\n> Then search results for \"Python\" are shown\\r\\n\\r\\nThis talk will teach how to use **behave** to develop well-designed test scenarios and a robust automation framework.

However, as datasets increase in size and collaboration extends to new populations of scientists these tools begin to feel their age.  In this talk we use more recent libraries to build a modern deployment for academic scientists.  In particular we use the following tools:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Dask:** to parallelize and scale NumPy computations\\r\\n- **XArray**: as a self-discribing data model and tool kit for labeled and index arrays\\r\\n- **JupyterLab:** to enable more APIs for users beyond the classic notebook\\r\\n- **JupyterHub:** to manage users and maintain environments for a new population of cloud-friendly users\\r\\n- **Kubernetes:** to manage everything and deploy easily on cloud hardware\\r\\n\\r\\nThis talk will focus less on how these libraries work and will instead be a case study of using them together in an operational setting.  During the talk we will build up and deploy a running system that the audience can then use to access distributed computing resources.', 'One of the most challenging and important thing fors for Python developers learn is the unittest mock library.

It also hasn't been sitting still, with a considerable amount of development work being done on mod\\\\_wsgi in the last few years to make it even more robust and easier to use in a development environment as well as production, including in containerised environments.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this talk you will learn about many features of mod\\\\_wsgi which you probably didn't even know existed, features which can help towards ensuring your Python web application deployment performs to its best, is secure, and has a low maintenance burden.\\r\\n\\r\\nTopics which will be covered include:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Easy deployment of Python web applications using mod\\\\_wsgi-express.\\r\\n* Integration of mod_wsgi-express with a Django web application.\\r\\n* Using mod\\\\_wsgi-express in a development environment.\\r\\n* How to make use of mod\\\\_wsgi-express in a production environment.\\r\\n* Using mod_wsgi-express in a containerised runtime environment.\\r\\n* Ensuring consistency between development and production environments using warpdrive.\\r\\n* Using mod\\\\_wsgi-express to bootstrap a system Apache installation for hosting WSGI applications.\\r\\n* Why you should be using daemon mode of mod\\\\_wsgi and not embedded mode.\\r\\n* How to properly associate mod\\\\_wsgi with a Python virtual environment.\\r\\n* Building a robust deployment that can recover from misbehaving application code, backend services, or request overloading.\\r\\n* Using hooks provided by mod\\\\_wsgi to monitor the performance of your Python web application.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are a beginner, come learn why mod\\\\_wsgi is still a good option for deploying your Python web applications. If you are an old time user of mod\\\\_wsgi, find out about all the features you probably didn't know existed, revisit your current Python web application deployment and make it even better.\", 'When you think of an API, youâ\\x80\\x99re probably thinking about a web service.

EDA and data visualization are the most crucial yet overlooked stage in analytics process. This is because they give insights on the most relevant features in a particular data set required to build an accurate model. It is often said that the more the data, the better the model but sometimes, this can be counter-productive as more data can be a disadvantage. EDA helps avoid that.\\r\\n\\r\\nEDA is useful for professionals while data visualization is useful for end-users. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor end-users: \\r\\nA good sketch is better than a long speech. The value of a machine learning model is not known unless it is used to make data driven decisions. It is therefore necessary for data scientists to master the act of telling a story for their work to stay relevant. This is where data visualization is extremely useful.  \\r\\nWe must remember that the end-users of the results are not professionals like us but people who know little or nothing about data analysis. For effective communication of our analysis, there is need for a detailed yet simple data visualization because the work of a data scientist is not done if data-driven insights and decisions are not made.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor professionals:\\r\\nHow do you ensure you are ready to use machine learning algorithms in a project? How do you choose the most suitable algorithms for your data set? How do you define the feature variables that can potentially be used for machine learning? Most data scientists ask these questions.  EDA answers these questions explicitly.\\r\\nAlso, EDA helps in understanding the data. Understanding the data brings familiarity with the data, giving insights on the best models that fit the data set, the features in the dataset that will be useful for building an accurate machine learning model, making feature engineering an easy process.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this talk, I will give a detailed explanation on what EDA and data visualization are and why they are very helpful in building accurate machine learning models for analytics as well as enhancing productivity and better understanding for clients. I will also discuss the risks of not mastering EDA and data visualization as a data scientist.', 'Congratulations on finishing your first tutorials or classes in python!

Python is famous for being simple and straightforward; can Python make concurrent programming simple and straightforward too? I think so.
