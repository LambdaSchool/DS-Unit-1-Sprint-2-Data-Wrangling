The project aims to build, deploy, and run apps for Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iPhone, and the web. It is native because it is actually using your platform's native GUI widgets, not a theme, icon pack, or webpage wrapper.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis talk will teach you how Toga, the BeeWare GUI toolkit, is architected and then show you how you can contribute to Toga by creating your own GUI widget in five easy steps.\""

              "\"Serverless computing is all about paying only for what you use: it can scale up to handle millions of requests, but it can also scale down to 0, costing you nothing if your application is not receiving any traffic. Serverless tends to get expensive when databases are involved.... but if your data is static or changes infrequently, you can use serverless tools to provide powerful interactive APIs extremely cheaply. [Datasette](https://datasette.readthedocs.io/) is an open-source Python tool that provides an instant, read-only JSON API for any SQLite database. It also provides tools for packaging the database up as a Docker container and instantly deploying that container to a number of different serverless hosting platforms. This makes it a powerful tool for sharing interesting data online, in a way that allows users to both explore that data themselves and build their own interpretations of the data using the Datasette JSON API. In this session I'll show you how to use Datasette to publish data, and illustrate examples of the exciting things people have already built using the tool - including a number of real-world data journalism projects. I'll also teach people how to use some of the other tools in the Datasette ecosystem: * [Datasette Publish](https://publish.datasettes.com/), which allows CSV data to be published using Datasette to a serverless hosting account owned by the user, without any engineering experience required. * [csvs-to-sqlite](https://pypi.org/project/csvs-to-sqlite/), a tool for efficiently converting large numbers of CSV files into a Datasette-compatible SQLite database. * [sqlite-utils](https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/), a library that lets users create complex databases from custom data feeds in just a few lines of Python code (ideal for working with Jupyter notebooks). I'll discuss the philosophy and design behind Datasette, including how immutable SQLite databases make for an impressively scalable solution for inexpensively serving complex data on the internet. Finally, I'll be exploring how Datasette takes advantage of Python 3 asyncio and the new ASGI specification.\""

            "We will look into a day in the life of a Software Engineer with limited vision to Understand their difficulties at work and how they can overcome those difficulties to become successful in their role. I am a backend Software Engineer at Yelp who uses Python extensively for building Yelps infrastructure and internal tools. I also suffer from a genetic disorder called Albinism which often results in limited visual acuity that can range from 20/120 to 20/200 in most common cases. With such a low vision it's extremely difficult to read the computer screen without the use of on-screen magnifiers. In this talk, we will see how a person with adverse visual acuity can thrive and be successful in the field of Software Engineering. We will address the importance and meaning of accessibility for Software Engineers with partial vision and recommend some best practices that are available today. We will also talk about the importance of an inclusive work culture that can help foster creativity and ease ramp up for a Software Engineer with a disability.\n",
            "If you maintain a library, how can you innovate without breaking the projects that depend on it? Follow semantic versioning, add APIs conservatively, add parameters compatibly, use DeprecationWarnings and publish a deprecation policy, guide your users on how to upgrade, and make wise choices about when to break backwards compatibility.\n",
            "Observability is often thought of as just a new word for monitoring. While it encompasses traditional devops areas such as monitoring, metrics, and infrastructure management, it’s much deeper and empowers developers at all levels of the stack. **Observability is about achieving a deep understanding of your software**. This not only helps you localize and debug production issues but removes uncertainty and speculation, **empowering developers** to know their tools and improving engineering excellence. Observability helps developers “understand the narrative” of what’s going on in their software. This talk is about how we’ve driven adoption of a culture of observability within our engineering culture. We'll define and motivate for our focus on observability; discuss the tangible tools we’ve built and best practices we’ve adopted to ingrain observability into our engineering culture; and provide some specific, real-world results we’ve achieved as part of this effort. We'll will focus particularly on the tooling we’ve adopted around Django and Celery and some interesting experiences we had extending their internals.\n",
            "We all have to package Python based applications for various environments, starting from command line tools, to web applications. And depending on the users, it can be installed on thousands on computers or on a selected few systems. https://pypi.org is our goto place for finding any dependencies and also in most of the time we install binary wheels directly from there, thus saving a lot time. But, Python is also being used in many environments where security is the utter most important, and validating the dependencies of project is also very critical along with the actual project source code. Many of noticed the recent incident where people were being able to [steal bticoins using a popular library](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/11/26/npm_repo_bitcoin_stealer/).This talk will take [SecureDrop client application](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client) for journalists as an example project and see how we tried to tackle the similar problem. SecureDrop is an Open Source whistleblower system which is deployed over 75 news organizations all over the world. Our threat model has nation state actors as possible threats, so, security and privacy of the users of the system is a very important point of the whole project. The tools in this case are build and packaged into reproducible Debian deb packages and are installed on Qubes OS in the final end user systems. There are two basic ways we handle Python project dependencies, for most of the development work, we use a virtualenv, and directly install the dependencies using wheels built from pypi.org. When we package the application for the end users, many times we package them using a operating system based package manager and ask the users to install using those (say RPM or Debian's deb package). In the second case, all the dependencies come as separate packages (and most of the time from the OS itself). The dependency is being handled by the OS package manager itself. That case, we can not update the dependencies fast enough if required, it depends on the packagers from the community who maintains those said packages in the distribution. We use [dh-virtualenv](https://dh-virtualenv.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/) project to help us to use our own wheels + a virtualenv for the project to be packaged inside the debian .deb package. This talk will go throuh [the process](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client) of building wheels from known (based on sha256sum) source tarballs, and then having a gpg signed list of updated wheels and [a private index](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-debian-packaging/tree/master/simple) for the same. And also how we are verifying the wheels' sha256sum (and the signature of that list) during the build process. The final output is reproducible Debian packages.\n",
            "The admin interface that comes built-in with Django is one of the most-loved (and oft-abused) features. However, early converts are often disappointed to find that the admin doesn't seem to be scaling as their database grows in size, forcing them (so they think) to switch to a custom interface much sooner than they would prefer. However, many common performance issues can be fixed with a few small configuration changes that are much easier than a rewrite! In this talk, we'll use an example project to demonstrate the most common performance pitfalls encountered when using the Django admin, and fix them - live! We'll use django-debug-toolbar, a powerful debugging interface that everyone who uses Django should be familiar with, to identify our issues and confirm that they are fixed.\n",
            "We may not always know why we feel a certain way about a great story. In this talk, you'll learn how Python generates new insights into the stories you love. See how some straightforward tools and techniques have generated a rich analysis of stories from \"Harry Potter\" to \"Wuthering Heights\" to \"The Three Body Problem\" and the deeper questions those findings raise. Learn the straightforward techniques to do this with findings and code samples from three case studies: + Uncovering gender bias in the _Harry Potter_ series + Visualizing the use of color in Gothic Literature + Looking for narrative patterns in science fiction novels over the last 50 years This mix of qualitative and quantitative data can be used to hold up a mirror to our world and to ourselves.

            "Python is known for its \"batteries included\" philosophy but no Python developer can live without the language's rich library ecosystem. Unfortunately, as the number of libraries increases, so does the risk of cross-library incompatibilities, or \"dependency hell\". Dependency hell arises when two libraries have mutually conflicting requirements. These can be very difficult for developers to diagnose and may not be fixable without avoiding certain libraries entirely. After this talk, you - the library author - will have a practical set of simple best practices to follow that will allow you to build libraries that are compatible across the Python ecosystem.\n",

With nearly nine years of experience as a remote employee across three different companies, [SPEAKER] knows the ups and downs of remote work. In this session, [SPEAKER] will dive into what the research says about remote work and share their personal stories of failures and successes. You'll walk away from this session knowing why remote work is awesome, empowered to convince your boss to let you work remotely, and armed with the tools you need to be a happy, successful remote employee.

            "According to the always trustworthy Wikipedia, there are approximately 360 million native English speakers in the world. We, as developers, are so used to write code and documentation in English that we may not realize that this number only represents 4.67% of the world population. It is very useful to have a common language for the communication between developers, but this doesn’t mean that the user shouldn’t feel a little bit more comfortable when using your product. Translation of terms is only one step in the whole Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n) process. It also entails number, date and time formatting, currency conversion, sorting, legal requirements, among other issues. This talk will go through the definition of i18n and l10n as well as show the main tools available for developers to support multiple languages and regional related preferences in their Python program. We will also see how one can enable local support for their website in Django. Finally, this presentation will discuss how we can manage Internationalization and Localization for a bigger product running in different platforms (front and back end) and how to incorporate i18n and l10n into our current development and deploy processes. Oh, and by the way, “eita!” is a Brazilian interjection to show yourself surprised with something. 🙂\n",
            "Millions of people across the world live in a state of acute and immediate environmental crisis caused by the lack of access to safe and usable water resources, because of natural disasters, socio-economic conditions, wars and conflicts. Over the last year, I developed extremely low-cost filtration devices at intersection of machine learning and chemical-free purification. With my organization, we deployed 8,000 of these devices in rural Tanzania and brought safe water access to over 40,000 people, filtered ~14.4 million liters of water, and saved women from those affected communities a cumulative of 15,000 hours of walking every day. In this talk, we’ll learn about how, as developers, engineers and data scientists, we are incredibly well equipped to build solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing our planet and my generation. We’ll explore how all of us, as individuals and as a community, can drive on-ground social impact and help entire communities in crises, through coding, data and technology.\n",
            "If we knew all of the bugs we needed to write tests for, wouldn't we just... not write the bugs? So how can testing find bugs that nobody would think of? The answer is to have a computer *write your tests for you!* You declare what kind of input should work - from 'an integer' to 'matching this regex' to 'this Django model' and write a test which should always pass... then Hypothesis searches for the smallest inputs that cause an error. If you’ve ever written tests that didn't find all your bugs, this talk is for you. We'll cover the theory of property-based testing, a worked example, and then jump into a whirlwind tour of the library: how to use, define, compose, and infer strategies for input; properties and testing tactics for your code; and how to debug your tests if everything seems to go wrong. By the end of this talk, you'll be ready to find real bugs with Hypothesis in anything from web apps to big data pipelines to CPython itself. Be the change you want to see in your codebase - or contribute to Hypothesis itself and help drag the world kicking and screaming into a new and terrifying age of high quality software!\n",

Current technologies for finding methane leaks in oil and gas infrastructure rely on driving well to well with a handheld camera. At Kairos Aerospace, we have developed a plane-mounted sensor for detecting methane leaks, but the sensor is only part of the solution: getting information off the sensor and into customers’ hands required us to build an entire plane-to-report pipeline. I’ll discuss the challenges we faced in developing a scalable, reliable, and cost-effective scientific computing platform in Python, with examples of novel solutions using Python’s extensive ecosystem of GIS, cloud computing and machine learning tools.\n",
            "Object Relational Mappers (ORMs) are awesome enhancers of developer productivity. The freedom of having the library write that SQL and give you back a useful, rich model instance (or a bunch of them) instead of just a tuple or a list of records is simply amazing. But if you forget you have an actual database behind all that convenience, then it'll bite you back, usually when you've been in production for a while, after you've accumulated enough data that your once speedy application starts slowing down do a crawl. Databases work best when you ask them once for (or to do) a bunch of stuff, instead of asking them lots of times for small stuff. We'll discuss how innocent looking attribute accesses on your model instances translate to sequential queries (the infamous [N+1 problem][1]). Then we'll go through some practical solutions, taken from real cases that resulted in massive speed ups. We'll cover how changes in Python code resulted in changes to the resulting SQL Queries Solutions not only for queries, but also inserts and updates, which tend to be less well documented. Though this talk focuses on SQLAlchemy, the lessons should be applicable to most ORMs in most programing languages. The ideas discussed, and solutions proposed are also valid for any storage backend, not only SQL databases. [1]: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/glossary.html#term-n-plus-one-problem\n",

            "Dropbox is a heavy user of the mypy type checker, recently passing three million lines of type-annotated Python code, with over half of that added in 2018. Type checking is helping find bugs, making code easier to under stand, enabling refactors, and is an important aid to our ongoing Python 3 migration. In this talk, we discuss how we got there. We’ll talk about what we tried in order to get our engineers to type annotate their code—what worked, what didn’t, and what our engineers had to say about it. Additionally, we’ll discuss the performance problems we faced as the size of our checked codebase grew, and the techniques we employed to allow mypy—which is implemented in Python—to efficiently check (faster than a second, for most incremental checks) millions of lines of code, which culminated in mypyc, a new ahead-of-time compiler for type-annotated Python!\n",
            "At Dropbox, we’ve always used Python to power our application for Windows, macOS and Linux (until recently, Python 2.7). Over the years, a growing lack of features and the need for outdated compilers/toolchains made migrating to Python 3 a necessity. Join us to hear the tale of our unique journey from Python 2 to 3 and the lessons we learned along the way: - We’ll discuss the reasons that led to our decision to make the jump. - We’ll dive into how we sequenced the transition by using the C-API to ship both versions of Python and choose one at runtime. - We’ll reveal the tools we used to enforce a hybrid (2/3) syntax for over hundreds of thousands of lines of Python code. - We’ll discuss some of our most spectacular bugs and gotchas, and how you can avoid them!\n",
            "Diagnosing a patient requires consideration of a wide variety of factors: past medical history and comorbidities, physical exam findings, lab results, imaging, ECG findings, and in some cases, genomic testing. Clinical diagnosis and prognostic assessment currently relies on expert knowledge of the treating physician. Recent developments in machine learning make it possible to build automated clinical diagnostic and risk assessment tools using data from the electronic medical record. This talk walks through the steps involved in building a clinical risk assessment model, using sepsis as a case study. A large part of the talk will focus on the tools and techniques involved in pre-processing complex medical data, and strategies for evaluating model results.\n",
            "Serverless computing is all about paying only for what you use: it can scale up to handle millions of requests, but it can also scale down to 0, costing you nothing if your application is not receiving any traffic. Serverless tends to get expensive when databases are involved.... but if your data is static or changes infrequently, you can use serverless tools to provide powerful interactive APIs extremely cheaply. [Datasette](https://datasette.readthedocs.io/) is an open-source Python tool that provides an instant, read-only JSON API for any SQLite database. It also provides tools for packaging the database up as a Docker container and instantly deploying that container to a number of different serverless hosting platforms. This makes it a powerful tool for sharing interesting data online, in a way that allows users to both explore that data themselves and build their own interpretations of the data using the Datasette JSON API. In this session I'll show you how to use Datasette to publish data, and illustrate examples of the exciting things people have already built using the tool - including a number of real-world data journalism projects. I'll also teach people how to use some of the other tools in the Datasette ecosystem: * [Datasette Publish](https://publish.datasettes.com/), which allows CSV data to be published using Datasette to a serverless hosting account owned by the user, without any engineering experience required. * [csvs-to-sqlite](https://pypi.org/project/csvs-to-sqlite/), a tool for efficiently converting large numbers of CSV files into a Datasette-compatible SQLite database. * [sqlite-utils](https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io/), a library that lets users create complex databases from custom data feeds in just a few lines of Python code (ideal for working with Jupyter notebooks). I'll discuss the philosophy and design behind Datasette, including how immutable SQLite databases make for an impressively scalable solution for inexpensively serving complex data on the internet. Finally, I'll be exploring how Datasette takes advantage of Python 3 asyncio and the new ASGI specification.\n",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feature flags can be powerful tools in mitigating risk in your development cycle — _if you use them correctly_. Failing to do so can have enormous consequences for yourself and your business. In 2012 one improperly deployed feature flag sent a $365 million company into bankruptcy in 45 minutes. So let’s talk about feature flags, specifically in how they can help us with intentional deployment. Feature flags give us a high degree of control over the features we release — but what ensures we have a high degree of control over our feature flags? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this talk, I’ll go over the best practices which will make your feature flagging program a success. The humble Feature Flag can transform into many different things: release toggle, experiment, kill switch, permissioning and more. I’ll talk briefly about the possibilities Feature Flags open up, and then describe how to use best practices of visibility and accountability to align those different flags into a cohesive feature flagging system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this talk, you’ll know what best practices make a successful feature flagging program, and be able to implement them into your current solution to deploy faster and with less risk.\n",
            "Starting a few years ago, Capital One has committed to go all-in on public cloud and open source software for many of our core business operations, processes, and machine learning models. To support this transformation, we embarked on a multi-year journey to build a Python community with critical mass of users, and scale adoption of Python in our business analyst and data analyst workforces. Python has been envisioned since its early days as a programming language which can be used to \"create better, easier to use tools for program development and analysis\", as well as \"build a user community around all of the above, encouraging feedback and self-help\". [1] In our experience scaling Python adoption amongst analyst communities within a Fortune 500 company, we have found the aforementioned visions true to form - not only is Python a great first programming language for our analysts to learn, it also comes with \"batteries included\" and contains many of the data-related tools and libraries which allows our analysts to get productive very quickly. This talk will highlight our multi-pronged approaches to overcome organizational inertia to build a community of Python users, provide Python and OSS training, and encourage Python adoption (with mixed success). We'll share what (we think) best practices are out there, and lessons learned along the way. Reference: [1] Computer Programming for Everybody (http://www.python.org/doc/essays/cp4e.html)\n",
            "Application security remains a long-term and high-stakes problem for most projects that interact with external users. Python's type system is already widely used for readability, refactoring, and bug detection — this talk will demonstrate how types can also be leveraged to make your project systematically more secure. We'll investigate (1) how static type checkers like Pyre or MyPy can be extended with simple library modifications to catch vulnerable patterns, and (2) how deeper type-based static analysis can reliably flag remaining use cases to security engineers. As an example, I'll focus on a basic security problem and how you might use both tools in combination, drawing from our experience deploying these methods to build more secure applications at Facebook and Instagram.\n",
            "Within the last few years, researchers have come to understand that machine learning systems may display discriminatory behavior with regards to certain protected characteristics, such as gender or race. To combat these harmful behaviors, we have created multiple definitions of fairness to enable equity in machine learning algorithms. In this talk, I will cover these different definitions of algorithmic fairness and discuss both the strengths and limitations of these formalizations. In addition, I will cover other best practices to better mitigate the unintended bias of data products.\n",
            "Notebooks have traditionally been a tool for drafting code and avoiding repeated expensive computations while exploring solutions. However, with new tools like nteract's papermill and scrapbook libraries, this technology has been expanded to make a reusable and parameterizable template for execution. We'll walk though how Jupyter notebooks are being programmatically used at Netflix and how this helps with our batch processing world.

            "While high-level security concepts may transcend languages, each language has its own sets of tools and edge cases that are worth knowing. Python is one of many popular languages that is rarely the focus in security training, but that doesn't mean python code is automatically secure (no matter what the internet tells you). Learn why people who say “pylint will help you with security” aren’t doing you any favours, how to use Bandit for security-focused linting and talk about other options for static analysis. Take a deeper look at why scanning for publicly known vulnerabilities is complicated, and how to use Pyup Safety to make it easier. We’ll also explore some language myths and best practices.\n",

This talk explores using Python to take raw terrain data - from aerial lidar and space-based radar scans - and processing it into 3D models, and CAD/CAM toolpaths, with the ultimate result of making Python-powered artwork of some of Earth's natural wonders. See how to reduce each National Park to a small, intricately-milled metal carving, how to laser-cut a side-on relief of a whole Hawaiian island, or how to 3D print tiny versions of cities where you can make out each individual building - and the strengths and challenges of using Python to handle 3D and GIS data.

Maybe you’ve given up on pip and have switched to Conda. But it doesn’t have to be this way! The Python Packaging Authority has been working hard to solve this problem with a new distribution format for compiled Python code, called “wheels.” In this talk, we’ll descend into the practice of PEPs 513 and 571: arcane scrolls that can equip Python developers with spells to pre-compile applications and libraries in a way that allows most Linux end users to run them directly. I’ll show you how to hex compiled artifacts and source code into the wheel format, harness application binary interfaces (ABIs) to use external libraries, brave the eldritch horrors of the dynamic linker, and bind these all together in the manylinux environment. Come learn to harness the black magic of Python wheels, and you too can spare your users pain… for a price.\n",
            "Many developers struggle to find the balance between striving to improve existing code and letting good enough alone by accepting certain shortcomings. As a new developer to a team it can be difficult to understand existing strategies and patterns that are sometimes flat out bad (and often openly acknowledged as such). Often the result of tight deadlines or unclear specifications, even the best developers write code they later look back upon with shudders. So how do we decide when refactoring is worth it? Come learn strategies for refactoring with minimal impact, methods for working with bad code you can’t change, and strategies for knowing the difference between what is fixable and what is better left alone.\n",

It has good advice for how to organize our code, but what does it have to say about how we organize ourselves? Plenty: the Zen of Python is not only a solid set of development principles, but the other easter egg is that it’s packed with wisdom about how to build healthy teams. In this talk I draw upon my time as an engineering manager of Python-focused engineering teams to tell stories of what the Zen of Python has to teach us about communication and conflict, building inclusive teams and transparent processes, and promoting psychological safety. Come ready to reflect on and feel inspired by a new interpretation of these principles, and bring what you learn back to your meetup, study group, open source project, or team.\n",

            "We will cover how we used Python to adapt to a large institutional processing setup. We used Python to create the definitions, configuration files, and supplementary metadata for each of the weather radars we worked with. We used a variety of custom tools to interface with existing systems and processes that would have been infeasible to work with otherwise. We took advantage of one of Python’s greatest strengths: its flexibility. We used it to perform the bulk of our data processing with NumPy, created custom utility functions to encourage code reuse, and created custom scripts for interfacing with the institutional data processing framework we worked within.\n",
            "Using the pandas python library requires a shift in thinking that is not always intuitive to those who use it. This talk will take a deep dive into the underlying data structure of pandas to explain why it performs the way it does under certain circumstances. It will explain why a MultiIndex DataFrame takes up less memory than it's simple counter part, why groupby should never be run on a non-MultiIndexed DataFrame, why the example documentation for the pandas apply function is an example of how not to use it, and how not taking the time to normalize data can affect performance.\n",
            "One of the reasons why programming in Python is very straightforward and simple is that we do not have to worry about the lifetime of our objects. That is, once it ceases to be necessary, a variable disappears from the memory \"magically\". The fact that this happens automatically can erroneously lead us to believe that it is not required to worry about what happens behind the scenes. Nothing is further from reality: knowing how Python manages memory is fundamental in specific scenarios, and not knowing what is happening can have consequences as significant as unpleasant. For example, if our programs manage a large amount of data at the same time or launch multiple processes in parallel, this ceases to be a theoretical issue and becomes something that we, logical minds, also care. Although these concepts tend to be considered advanced and difficult to understand, we will see that this is not the case. This topic is not a purely theoretical matter nor is it difficult to find its practical applications. In this talk, we will explain why it is something that should matter to us, and we will talk about how to apply the knowledge we have gained to specific problems.\n"
