A particularly flexible form of probabilistic models uses Bayesian *non-parametric* methods, which allow models to vary in complexity depending on how much data are available. In doing so, they avoid the over-fitting that is common in machine learning and statistical modeling. I will demonstrate the basics of Bayesian non-parametric modeling in Python, using the PyMC3 package.

Using **behave**, teams write Gherkin behavior scenarios (e.g., tests) in plain language, and then programmers write Python code to automate the steps. BDD testing is great because tests are self-documenting and steps abide by the DRY principle. An example test could be:\\r\\n\\r\\n&gt; Given the DuckDuckGo home page is displayed\\r\\n&gt; When the user searches the phrase &quot;Python&quot;\\r\\n&gt; Then search results for &quot;Python&quot; are shown\\r\\n\\r\\nThis talk will teach how to use **behave** to develop well-designed test scenarios and a robust automation framework.

However, when making charts, customarily we are just re-sizing lines and circles based on metrics instead of creating data-driven version of reality.  The contemporary charting techniques have a few shortcomings (especially when dealing with high-dimensional dataset): \\r\\n\\r\\n* **Context Reduction**: in order to fit a high-dimensional dataset into a chart one needs to filter/ aggregate/ flatten data which results in reduction of full context of information.  Without context most of the charts show only a part of the story, that can potentially lead to data misinterpretation/misunderstanding. \\r\\n* **Numeric Thinking**: naturally humans have hard time perceiving big numbers. While data visualization is suppose to help us to conceptualize large volumes,  unless the dataset is carefully prepared, 2D charts rarely give us the intuitive grasp of magnitude. \\r\\n* **Perceptual de-humanization**: when examining charts it is easy to forget that we are dealing with activity in real world instead of lines/bars. \\r\\n\\r\\nAugmented/Mixed Reality can potentially solve all of the issues listed above by presenting an intuitive and interactive environment for data exploration.

Python&#39;s versatility and rich ecosystem means we can use it for everything from predicting our traffic patterns to orchestrating traffic movement, while dealing with the eventual consistency of AWS.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, we can shift all of our 100 million+ users in under seven minutes. A lot of engineering work went into making this possible. The issues we faced and solutions we created have broad application to availability strategies in the cloud or the datacenter.</div>\\n  \\n    <h2>\\n      <a id=\"presentation-157\"\\n         href=\"/2018/schedule/presentation/157/\">\\n        HOWTO Write a Function\\n      </a>\\n    </h2>\\n    <p>\\n      <b>\\n        Jack Diederich\\n        \\n      </b>\\n      \\n      <br>\\n      <b>\\n        Saturday\\n        12:10 p.m.&ndash;12:55 p.m.\\n        in\\n        Room 26A/B/C\\n      </b>\\n      \\n    </p>\\n    <div class=\"presentation-description\"\\n         >A function is a small chunk of code that does useful work.

How does a _robot (agent)_ interpret an instruction in the environment to infer the correct course of action? Enabling harmonious _Human - Robot Interaction_ is of primary importance if they are to work seamlessly alongside people.\\r\\n\\r\\nDealing with natural language instructions in hard because of two main reasons, first being, Humans - through their prior experience know how to interpret natural language but agents can√¢\\x80\\x99t, and second is overcoming the ambiguity that is inherently associated with natural language instructions. This talk is about how deep learning models were used to solve such complex and ambiguous problem of converting natural language instruction into its corresponding action sequence.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing verbal route instructions requires knowledge of language, space, action and perception. In this talk I shall be presenting, a neural sequence-to-sequence model for direction following, a task that is essential to realize effective autonomous agents.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a high level, a sequence-to- sequence model is an end-to-end model made up of two recurrent neural networks: \\r\\n\\r\\n - **Encoder** - which takes the model√¢\\x80\\x99s input sequence as input and encodes it into a fixed-size context vector.\\r\\n - **Decoder** - which uses the context vector from above as a seed from which to generate an output sequence. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor this reason, sequence-to-sequence models are often referred to as _encoder-decoder_ models. The alignment based encoder-decoder model would translate the natural language instructions into corresponding action sequences. This model does not assume any prior linguistic knowledge: syntactic, semantic or lexical. The model learns the meaning of every word, including object names, verbs, spatial relations as well as syntax and the compositional semantics of the language on its own.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this talk, steps involved in pre-processing of data, training the model, testing the model and final simulation of the model in the virtual environment will be discussed. This talk will also cover some of the challenges and trade-offs made while designing the model.</div>\\n  \\n    <h2>\\n      <a id=\"presentation-156\"\\n         href=\"/2018/schedule/presentation/156/\">\\n        Love your bugs\\n      </a>\\n    </h2>\\n    <p>\\n      <b>\\n        Allison Kaptur\\n        \\n      </b>\\n      \\n      <br>\\n      <b>\\n        Friday\\n        5:10 p.m.&ndash;5:40 p.m.\\n        in\\n        Grand Ballroom C\\n      </b>\\n      \\n    </p>\\n    <div class=\"presentation-description\"\\n         >Wrestling bugs can be one of the most frustrating parts of programming - but with the right framing, bugs can also be our best allies.

You can consider this talk as a teaser of Python 3 features that you may have never used.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this talk I hope you&#39;ll be inspired to fully upgrade your code to Python 3.</div>\\n  \\n    <h2>\\n      <a id=\"presentation-86\"\\n         href=\"/2018/schedule/presentation/86/\">\\n        Python 3: ten years later\\n      </a>\\n    </h2>\\n    <p>\\n      <b>\\n        Victor Stinner\\n        \\n      </b>\\n      \\n      <br>\\n      <b>\\n        Saturday\\n        3:15 p.m.&ndash;4 p.m.\\n        in\\n        Grand Ballroom B\\n      </b>\\n      \\n    </p>\\n    <div class=\"presentation-description\"\\n         >Looking back at Python evolutions over the last 10 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nPython 3.0 was released ten years ago (December 2008).

EDA and data visualization are the most crucial yet overlooked stage in analytics process. This is because they give insights on the most relevant features in a particular data set required to build an accurate model. It is often said that the more the data, the better the model but sometimes, this can be counter-productive as more data can be a disadvantage. EDA helps avoid that.\\r\\n\\r\\nEDA is useful for professionals while data visualization is useful for end-users. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor end-users: \\r\\nA good sketch is better than a long speech. The value of a machine learning model is not known unless it is used to make data driven decisions. It is therefore necessary for data scientists to master the act of telling a story for their work to stay relevant. This is where data visualization is extremely useful.  \\r\\nWe must remember that the end-users of the results are not professionals like us but people who know little or nothing about data analysis. For effective communication of our analysis, there is need for a detailed yet simple data visualization because the work of a data scientist is not done if data-driven insights and decisions are not made.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor professionals:\\r\\nHow do you ensure you are ready to use machine learning algorithms in a project? How do you choose the most suitable algorithms for your data set? How do you define the feature variables that can potentially be used for machine learning? Most data scientists ask these questions.  EDA answers these questions explicitly.\\r\\nAlso, EDA helps in understanding the data. Understanding the data brings familiarity with the data, giving insights on the best models that fit the data set, the features in the dataset that will be useful for building an accurate machine learning model, making feature engineering an easy process.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this talk, I will give a detailed explanation on what EDA and data visualization are and why they are very helpful in building accurate machine learning models for analytics as well as enhancing productivity and better understanding for clients.

              "<div class=\"presentation-description\">Nowadays, there are many ways of building data science models using Python, including statistical and machine learning methods. I will introduce probabilistic models, which use Bayesian statistical methods to quantify all aspects of uncertainty relevant to your problem, and provide inferences in simple, interpretable terms using probabilities.  A particularly flexible form of probabilistic models uses Bayesian *non-parametric* methods, which allow models to vary in complexity depending on how much data are available. In doing so, they avoid the over-fitting that is common in machine learning and statistical modeling. I will demonstrate the basics of Bayesian non-parametric modeling in Python, using the PyMC3 package. Specifically, I will introduce two common types, Gaussian processes and Dirichlet processes, and show how they can be applied easily to real-world problems using two examples.</div>\n",

In Python, **behave** is one of the leading BDD test frameworks. Using **behave**, teams write Gherkin behavior scenarios (e.g., tests) in plain language, and then programmers write Python code to automate the steps. BDD testing is great because tests are self-documenting and steps abide by the DRY principle. An example test could be:\n",
