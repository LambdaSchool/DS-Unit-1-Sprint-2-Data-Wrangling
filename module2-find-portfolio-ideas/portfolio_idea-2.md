# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
Health and Human Longevity & Big, Secure, Computing

What do you know about?
Datasets can get big quickly and past a certain size need special tooling.

What decisions do you face?
Which frameworks to use in my situation, for industry.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Heat and electricity cost are an issue.  Running all these computers at high usage will cost a lot of money in cooling and general electricity costs.

2. Trend related to the news
Big data is huge.  Big data requires a lot of these tools chained together in pipelines few understand.

3. Who does that?
Data engineers and scientists.  

4. Answering a question people care about
Developers will care.  Ease of setup and code porting could be huge.

5. Valuable to businesses
Potentially very valuable as being able to turn work networks into **temporary supercomputers** could be huge.

6. What's the most popular?
Big giant super computers, but some frameworks should still scale alright.

7. Cost/Money rankings
Cost savings could be massive if companies have underutilized capacity available for the exercise - if it can be done securely without impacting normal workflow.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
That the cloud is the only option or supercomputer time is necessary for smaller, but still large, datasets.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-learned-to-love-parallelized-applies-with-python-pandas-dask-and-numba-f06b0b367138

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Yes.  The impossible possible on a home machine.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Yes.  Deploying dask.distributed on a home network - is it worth it?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Yes.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
Randomly generated dataset will do, or can use large esoteric one like age of death over time in different areas via CDC data or similar records.

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
