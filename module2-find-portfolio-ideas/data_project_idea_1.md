# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?

I am very interested in how people (including myself) choose to spend their time, and the result that those choices have on their productivity, happiness, and success/influence. I personally have gone through phases where I "wasted" time on various activities which I later deemed to be unuseful or even harmful to my personal well-being, growth and happiness.

What do you know about?

I have been gathering data on my own life over the last couple of years in an effort to become more accountable for my time and behavior. I have learned quite a bit about where my time goes and how much time is simply forgotten.

What decisions do you face?

Everyday—really every moment of every day—I face the decision of which activities on which I spend my time. Everyone else who has some degree of liberty also faces the same choices.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

Differences in how people in different regions spend their time (would be awesome to have productivity data as well).  

2. Trend related to the news

A recent trend that comes to mind is questioning the value of time spent on social media.

3. Who does that?

Differences in how individuals of various ages and cultures choose to spend their time. Or, the time that is spent doing various activities that they do not choose to do.

4. Answering a question people care about

What percentage of a person's day/month/year is spent doing X? I think some very interesting ones that would grab readers' attention would be the mundane activities, or those that are common among all people of all ages and cultures. e.g. sitting on the toilet, sleeping, eating, etc.

Another avenue of inquiry that would probably pique interest is finding relationships between use of time and happiness/satisfaction.

5. Valuable to businesses

One especially valuable piece of information for just about any business is what are the pain points of everyday life for different segments of the population. Most businesses who sell a product or service are trying to alleviate one or more of those pain points for a certain market. This information would not only be valuable for developing new products, but could determine the best marketing methods or design tweaks. That is only scratching the surface of the value that good data on this topic would bring.

Another aspect of this that could be valuable has to do with internal productivity. For example, this data and analysis could provide some insight into optimizing employees' time for maximum productivity.

6. What's the most popular?

Which activities are most common for individuals over time?  
Which activities are most common across ages, cultures, and geographical boundaries?
At what point does an activity become a habit, and what effect do others/the society as a whole have on that threshold?

7. Cost/Money rankings

Which activities cost the most to the individual and/or the company?
Which activities are most lucrative for the individual and/or organization?
How do the most successful individuals/companies spend their time?

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

I'd imagine that one misconception about use of time is that the amount of time spent doing an activity necessarily has a positive relationship with mastery or success in that activity or field.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

Many articles on the Pudding have been very inspirational for me. For this example, I'll use [30 Years of American Anxieties](https://pudding.cool/2018/11/dearabby/).

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

The essay does not so much have a hypothesis as much as is an exploration of the topic of common concerns. The essay is interactive to a degree, so the reader can browse the data according to what they find is interesting. The interactivity is one reason the Pudding is so inspirational to me. To force a more direct answer, a new hypothesis could be: the most common worries among all groups are not those that are espoused in the media.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

What are the least common concerns for each age group? Each Location?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

This style would work well with the use of time topic.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

I found a very useful dataset on Kaggle which has detailed data on the [time usage of Europeans](https://www.kaggle.com/yuchendai/european-time-use). The dataset only has 28 rows, but should still prove very useful for this project. I also have a large dataset that I've been accumulating over the last couple of years which has data on what activities I did and for how long, along with some other data.
