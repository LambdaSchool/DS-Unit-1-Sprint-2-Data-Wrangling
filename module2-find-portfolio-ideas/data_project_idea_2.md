# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?

One of my lifelong passions is science and technology. More specifically, I am passionate about exploring the cutting edge (and beyond) of what is possible, and how the progress of such fields affect culture and society. This is one of the main reasons I am an avid science-fiction reader, writer, and enthusiast—the different ways that technology can change society is something that should be explored deeply. If we can start conversations about the ramifications of technological advances before those advances begin to shape our culture and society, I believe the probability of that change being positive is much higher than if we waited to talk about these things until they are happening.

What do you know about?

Although I am not an engineer, physicist, or anything like that, I have at least basic knowledge about many STEM fields and keep up with science and technology news. I am constantly consuming science-fiction content, and have done so basically since I started reading around the age of 6. Therefore, I have relatively deep knowledge about many of the concepts put forth by science-fiction authors over the decades. I also know that popular media has an effect on culture and society, and love to read content that explores the topic.

What decisions do you face?

As a writer of science-fiction, a couple of the important decisions I am always considering are: whether to write dystopian or utopian (simplifying this for brevity), and what types of technologies and concepts to explore.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

Popularity of science-fiction subgenres and (if possible) most frequent concepts, technologies, and/or topics by country, state, or region. Gather data via social media such as Twitter in order to analyze technological sentiment on various technologies, real and/or fictional, and futuristic ideas.

2. Trend related to the news

New technologies are always in the news cycle, whether it is positive coverage of a new gadget or negative coverage of the effects of a certain technology. One example that comes to mind is the recent negative coverage of companies like Facebook and Google, because of the societal power that their innovations have provided and the ethics of how they are using that power.

3. Who does that?

The demographic breakdown of who uses the technologies and/or who consumes the media around those technologies would be very valuable and interesting data to analyze.

4. Answering a question people care about

How does the popular sentiment surrounding a technology or field affect innovation in that field?  
How much of an effect does popular media (news, books, films) have on popular sentiment of a technology or field?
How has the general sentiment (optimism, pessimism) of technology changed over time? And are there any big watershed moments that changed it?
What effect do scientific papers or scientific progress in general have on science-fiction?

5. Valuable to businesses

If the level and tone of news coverage and other media surrounding a technology or field can predict a certain level of success of new products or growth in the market, then the data and analysis would certainly be valuable to any business in that market. Another valuable result that is related but slightly different is the potential to create a higher level of success with a product launch by preceding the launch with certain media content and/or coverage in key places such that the market is more receptive to the product or technology.

6. What's the most popular?

A ranking of the most popular subgenres of science-fiction, what concepts/technologies are explored in those stories, and how that relates to the most popular technology at the time.

7. Cost/Money rankings

The subgenres, concepts, and technologies of the best-selling science-fiction (and to a certain extent, fiction in general) would be interesting to compare with the those topics in the real world. i.e. mentions, articles, etc. of a certain idea that is explored in the top fiction books of each year—or, even better—each month.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

One that frequently comes up is that all science-fiction is dystopian—i.e. the stories all explore what happens when something goes terribly wrong. I think an equally-interesting area to explore is the utopian—i.e. provide an example of how things could go incredibly right. 

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

Many of the data essays on the Pudding have been incredibly inspirational for me. My favorites so far are [Population Mountains](https://pudding.cool/2018/12/3d-cities-story/), [Science, etc.](https://pudding.cool/2019/05/science_etc_1/), and [Are Pop Lyrics Getting More Repetitive?](https://pudding.cool/2017/05/song-repetition/). For this exercise, I will choose Science, etc.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

The main argument is that much of the data backing up scientific research is not accessible, and therefore the results cannot be easily verified (if at all), leading to an erosion in the perceived trustworthiness of scientific research. Another hypothesis for the question, "what is the cause of the erosion in trust in scientific research?", could be: social media and the deluge of questionable information caused by access to the internet is causing the erosion.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

Does access to the raw data increase the perceived trustworthiness of scientific studies?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

A related topic could be the erosion of trust in popular media.


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

There are many sources of data about books and media. I've found multiple datasets on Kaggle and Google Data Search that provide information on book sales, popularity, and genres over time.

As far as the current and/or historical sentiment, that could be gathered from social media or from other media-related datasets.
