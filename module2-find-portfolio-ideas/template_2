# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
Housing Markets

What do you know about?
How demand affects housing markets and price fluctuations without median income influence

What decisions do you face?
Choosing how to find the scope and markets of the project without bias and how to provide storytelling and commentary without bias

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
All geographic areas have a housing market, the issue will be to compare them by population sizes and median incomes

2. Trend related to the news
Constant housing market fluctuations and home ownership issues in larger metros becoming unfeasible for the median family.

3. Who does that?
People looking to buy homes and better understand the markets and how far their dollar goes
Why certain metros are priced the way they are and how home prices in those areas are influenced.

4. Answering a question people care about
What are the reasons for housing market bubbles and the arbitrary home cost increases?
Does it boil out to something besides basic economics of demand vs supply
5. Valuable to businesses
How to price houses in metro markets.
6. What's the most popular?
Where houses are affordable in metros around the US


7. Cost/Money rankings
Affordability and cost-effectiveness of owning a home. Is the trend of home ownership out the American dream in larger metros or is income inequality the new epidemic that plagues metros along with homelessness being the extreme alongside the multi-million dollar homes on the opposite end of the spectrum?

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
That home ownership is for the ultra-rich when in fact in many metros that have more affordable housing prices do exist.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

Being able to take public data and use it to create a compelling story that includes much of a human element

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Could housing be more affordable by decreasing price? What consequences could that have?

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
What size house would be the most cost-effective and efficient housing?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Could food costs be lowered to a minimum value that would make food another basic human right of living in America instead of having people hungry and starving?

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
