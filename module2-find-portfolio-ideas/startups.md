# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
  - Start-Ups/VC

What do you know about?
  - I worked for 4 years as an asset allocator (university endowment), so I understand the fundraising process, but from one layer further away from the actual companies deploying capital.

What decisions do you face?
  - Where I'll want to work when I'm done at LS.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
  - Where are start-ups that I'd be interested in finding capital from VCs/other sources?
  - Are there any regions w/ areas of focus?

2. Trend related to the news
  - There is a small but hungry regional interest in a Midwest start-up scene. Piggy-backing on some of there work could be an easy way to get some traction.

3. Who does that?
  - What are the demographics by industry/ by region?
  - In my area, who specifically are the players?

4. Answering a question people care about
  - Are VC websites good ways to source job opportunities for fields you'd be interested in?

5. Valuable to businesses
  - It's another angle to track talent/capital market trends.

6. What's the most popular?
  - Most popular destination of funds, by company type.

7. Cost/Money rankings
  - It's more expensive capital on the coasts (entry prices are higher)

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
  - I'm really not sure for a tech audience. I'm new here...

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
https://www.cbinsights.com/research/

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
  - I don't know. I'm relatively conservative with regard to offering up a hypothesis in writing without spending more time on a topic.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
  - Probably a more narrow focus on the Midwest would be interesting (to me anyway)

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
  - Definitely.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
  - Data accessable through friends from my last job
  - "Source" lines in reports from CB Insights, PitchBook, etc. (but I believe those are behind a pay-wall)

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
