# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
> I'm curious about the patterns of independent electronic music label releases, artist collaborations, and genre labels.

What do you know about?
> I have a passing familiarity with some of the labels and artists, particularly for melodic techno / deep tech and what might be loosely considered a deep house / world music crossover genre, as well as some experience with common genre controversies (tech house vs. housey techno, for example).

What decisions do you face?
> This is relevant to the music discovery process. It may also have some relevance for the best strategies for networking and submission for music producers, or, conversely, talent recruitment from the label side.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
> Yes. While music labels do generally have a 'home' country, the process is quite international, and many artists are from one country but based in another, or simply travel extensively. Still, some analysis could probably be done on this level.

2. Trend related to the news
> No, this is not a particularly timely topic, except insofar as the popularity of electronic music continues to increase.

3. Who does that?
> No, this is not really a question about purchase or usage statistics, more about collaboration and publishing patterns.

4. Answering a question people care about
> No, all of the relevant data is public.

5. Valuable to businesses
> No, except insofar perhaps as genre labels and artist combinations can be used to predict track sales - but very few electronic music labels are profitable, regardless.

6. What's the most popular?
> No, again, as discussed above. In any case, the relative popularity of artists, labels, and genres is hardly novel or interesting information. The relative popularity of tracks by musical key could be a curious statistic, I suppose.

7. Cost/Money rankings
> As with #6, above, there is little novel or interesting in the financial data here unless perhaps one were to turn up something with an unusual categorization such as key, track length, or number of collaborators.


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
> I'm not really sure what the popular imagination has to say about electronic music labels.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

> https://remixrotation.com/best-of-2018.html

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question? Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
I could ask which genres, labels, or artists see the most remixes or other collaborations. I could ask which labels publish the most cross-genre releases, or which genres are more likely to be released on specialty vs. cross-genre labels.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
> I could run a similar analysis on the "top X" for a specific genre or time period, or using a different sales website.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
