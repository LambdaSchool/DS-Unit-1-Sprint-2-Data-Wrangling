# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

**(github personal website: lucguittard.github.io)** 

What do you care about? 
Politics (public engagement/participation in the process), nutrition (at the macro-nutrient level), science fiction and its presence in public discourse

What do you know about? 
International Relations, studying political stakeholders and their influence (theoretical or empirical) in politics, studying political participation, a general socio-economic based dietary divide, several futurists and the content they produce 

What decisions do you face? 
Will OpenSecrets.org contact me soon with an update on the status of my request for an API key so that I may access their data? And if not, how do I proceed with my planned DS project if lacking an independent variable? Should I just focus my attention on the relationship between the confounding and dependent variables for which I've collected data? How much data (entries) should a DS project seek to be handling? Can I capably explain such a project and its significance as an illustrator of DS skills to potential employers? Do my visualizations of the variables and associated data inspire serious reflection among viewers unfamiliar with the topic?


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation: 
Geographical representation of sci-fi content consumption


2. Trend related to the news: 
How have rising international trade tensions (ie. between the US and China) affected lobbying efforts in Congress?


3. Who does that?: 
What group demographics are most significant in determining the consumption of a particular type of food product? (think of an identity politics chart)


4. Answering a question people care about: 
On what day of the week does Congress pass the most bills into law? A Time-series of sales of alcohol in DC?


5. Valuable to businesses:
Regular vs irregular party contributions and lobbying expenditures: Which is more effective? 


6. What's the most popular?:
What are the most popular sources of protein/carbs/fats? w/geographical breakdown?


7. Cost/Money rankings:
Which companies/organizations spend the most in lobbying efforts?


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
None. The lobbying data that is available does not tell the whole story, just as one would expect that there are under-the-table political negotiations and corrupt practices saturating DC. Public perceptions are hardly a clear measure, dependent on factors such as the framing of poll questions. There are few organizations that attempt to provide a regular, controlled measure of public perception. 


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
There is no shortage of Ted talks with cool and inspiring visualizations of data. One that comes to mind is Hans Rasling on Religions & Babies (see: https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_religions_and_babies).

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question? 
Based on academic literature, what should one hypothesize? I hypothesize that one could draw either (null) hypothesis for the potential influence of religious practice on baby-making. 

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
A new question would concern the distribution of religious practice across socio-economic groupings/levels

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Style? That is a deep focus on groupings of peoples by their religious affiliation? If that is the question, then no, I would not repeat the style. I could, however, attempt to replicate the time-series aspect, generating a 'living' plot based on lobbying data, grouping individual contributions by sector/industry, representing each of these groups by 'living' bubbles, dependent on the size of the contribution

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic? 
OpenSecrets.org has an effective monopoly on all the desirable data related to lobbying expenditures in the US. They offer APIs for access to their raw data. Gallup has regularly poled on the question of Congressional corruption since the mid-'70s. The Corruption Perception Index, by Transparency International, is a measure of expert- percieved corruption at the country-level that began in 1995. 

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
