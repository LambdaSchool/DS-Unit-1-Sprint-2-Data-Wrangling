# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
I care about social studies, especially geography, sociology, and psychology.

What do you know about?
I have taken several college classes on Geography and Urban Studies, and I have been reading a lot of classic Psychology books recently.

What decisions do you face?
I think an important question to pursue in psychology is whether depression/anxiety sources from chemical imbalance or existential angst. I think finding patterns between socio-economics and mental health will determine the nature of existential health in the United States.
## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
How does mental health differ among regions of different racial/socio-economic backgrounds?

2. Trend related to the news
Which attribtutes factor into the obesity epidemic in America? How can we predict obesity in children?

3. Who does that?
Which people are most likely to develop mental heatlh disorders such as anxiety and depression?

4. Answering a question people care about
Can we prove the age of anxiety with big data?

5. Valuable to businesses
How does mental health affect productivity in the workplace?

6. What's the most popular?
What is the most popular coping mechanism for existential angst?

7. Cost/Money rankings
Which mental health treatments are most expensive? Which neighborhood revitalization tools are most cost effective?

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Many people assume all forms of anxiety and depression are based on chemical imbalances rather than neruoses formed from early childhood, which deems all treatment to be based on symptom alleviation.
In other words, many scientists see mental health as a problem of the agency of the indivdiual, rather than a combination of personal brain chemistry and structural shortcomings of society and community or lack thereof.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
Eric Klilenberg wrote a book called "Heat Wave," which tells the story of the 1995 Chicago heatwave. He determined that demographics determined the geography of survival rates. His data indicated that some of the strongest factor to determine the survival rate of a neighborhood was not race or class, but strength of community.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Another hypothesis for my question "How do class and occupation affect mental health of individuals in New York City?" is that access to mental health professionals is the only factor that affects mental health. 

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
"How does access to mental health support in a local community affect the rates of anxiety and depression in the neighborhood?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Food deserts and physical health.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
I will be looking at .SAS databases provided by the City of New York.
