# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about? 

Reading, cooking, exercise, sports, news, healthcare.


What do you know about?

Finance (although I'm not particularly interested in it anymore), I read widely and up to date on the news.

Idea 1: found a NYT developer API. Interested in analyzing the coverage of particular topics or geographic locations over time.

Idea 2: Using healthdata.gov to explore a healthcare issue. There are >3,000 datasets so will take some perusing to decide. Possibly drug overdose deaths.


What decisions do you face?

Idea 1: getting a feel for the data available. Deciding on particular topic to explore more deeply. For example, coverage of the Vietnam before, during, and after the Vietnam War.

Idea 2: Finding a useful for storytelling dataset out of the many available. 


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

I1: Yes. 

I2: Yes. 

2. Trend related to the news

I1: Yes, inherently.

I2: Yes, healthcare and particularly opioid overdoses are currently a huge issue.


3. Who does that?

I1: No.

I2: Yes, can track demographics.


4. Answering a question people care about

I1: News buffs, journalists, etc., would find it interesting.

I2: Yes.


5. Valuable to businesses

I1: I doubt it.

I2: Possibly.


6. What's the most popular?

I1: Could track output of coverage of a topic with related external factors. I.e. I imagine higher casualties and large protests resulted in extra coverage.

I2: No.


7. Cost/Money rankings

I1: No.

I2: Possibly. Could track regions with higher overdose deaths with economic performance.


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

I1: I'm not sure there are any common conceptions in the first place.

I2: I'm not sure.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

This gapminder chart of income and health breakdown by country. Visually appealing and conveys a lot of information.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

Slightly different question, but country income can be compared to topics other than 'health.'

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

Family size by country income/education.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

Plenty!


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
