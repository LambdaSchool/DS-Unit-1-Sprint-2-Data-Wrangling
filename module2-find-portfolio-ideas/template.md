# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
- best practice, ethics, progress, human rights, data
- education
- democratic access to and use of the electromagnetic spectrum for information
- best practice in file formatting

What do you know about?
- education
- international patterns in organizational protocols

What decisions do you face?
- how to integrate and optimize projects

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

(Four Projects)
A. AI-Optimized Distaster-Relief Network-Protocol
B. Educational and Institutional Best Practice Metrics and Protocols
C. PT-OT Metrics: image recognition for standardized physical performance evaluation
D. Ocean/Beach Cleanup
Pictures of beaches and debris.
e.g.
- identifying where to put images geographically (with or w/o geotagging)
(maybe looking for geotag issues...)
- sorting images by date
- webscraping for images
- analyzing images for debris

1. geographic variation
A. AI-Optimized Distaster-Relief Network-Protocol
Highly relevant to project A, as I focuses on the dynamic relative distribution of participants in space.

B. Educational and Institutional Best Practice Metrics and Protocols
Primarily there should not be overt differences in best practice, but there will be some cultural formalities and there may be some genetic difference based considerations in populations (e.g. behavioral propensities associated with best practice...maybe controversial of vague)

C. PT-OT Metrics: image recognition for standardized physical performance evaluation
Primarily there should not be geographic differences in e.g. whether a person walking along a straight line deviates from that line.

D. Ocean/Beach Cleanup
Sorting and looking for patterns in images over space and time is key.


2. data in the news
A. AI-Optimized Distaster-Relief Network-Protocol
The news: disasters
B. Educational and Institutional Best Practice Metrics and Protocols
Items that indirectly affect education may be interesting...education is usually ignored.
C. PT-OT Metrics: image recognition for standardized physical performance evaluation
E.g. #me_too; US forest service scandal; US socar tital 9 issue, 
D. Ocean/Beach Cleanup Image Processing
predicting increases or decreases in amt. of debris after news events (natural diasters), non-seasonal festivals (concerts)

3. What people are directly and indirectly affected by/ would use project?
A. AI-Optimized Distaster-Relief Network-Protocol
some areas more than others, gulf cuast, ring of fire
B. Educational and Institutional Best Practice Metrics and Protocols
for education most people are 'indirectly' affected since edu is a long term investment with unclear short term returns. in terms of general institutional tools, all groups and projects of any size are applicable. 
C. PT-OT Metrics: image recognition for standardized physical performance evaluation
Ideally these tools would extend the pool or applicable people from the most severe cases with most costly access to care to more of the general population for general care prevension and diagnostics
D. Ocean/Beach Cleanup Image Processing:
indirectly this affects everyone, but like EDU it is hard to define indirect benifits.
coastal buisnesses and municipalities would be most directly affects, maybe some people plan their vacation on visual-track-database-schedules but probably very few.

4. secret data answering a question people care about:
A. AI-Optimized Distaster-Relief Network-Protocol
average distance between people over time, mapped over geography (and time)
B. Educational and Institutional Best Practice Metrics and Protocols
how many cases of abuse and fraud there actually are
C. PT-OT Metrics: image recognition for standardized physical performance evaluation
how does the average person in daily life compare to PT/OT diagnostics guidelines (do most people need therapy?...as with pyschology...the answer is likely yes)
D. Ocean/Beach Cleanup
where does the trash come from, where does it go, when and where


5. data valuable to business:
A. AI-Optimized Distaster-Relief Network-Protocol
network efficiency does effect many businessses and public sector institutions
B. Educational and Institutional Best Practice Metrics and Protocols
tools to reduce waste and fraud are of value
C. PT-OT Metrics: image recognition for standardized physical performance evaluation
as one example, work-place productivity is severely impeded by undiagnosed performance deficits.
D. Ocean/Beach Cleanup
asside from future pollution liability costs which are doubtful, mostly this would be local municipalites and buisneses that are affected by polution





6. most popular X?
A. AI-Optimized Distaster-Relief Network-Protocol
popularity and bandwidth for tourism? (inverse??)
B. Educational and Institutional Best Practice Metrics and Protocols
popular workplaces vs. toxic environments
C. PT-OT Metrics: image recognition for standardized physical performance evaluation
popular activites vs. common disabilities
D. Ocean/Beach Cleanup
Most popular vs. most poluted areas

trends in popularity...
- traffic patterns?
- uses of traffic resources?
racehorse-most-popular-X animated histogram


7. cost and money rankings...
Hidden Costs:
A. AI-Optimized Distaster-Relief Network-Protocol
Hidden  Costs of network inefficiency and EM spectrum misuse
B. Educational and Institutional Best Practice Metrics and Protocols
Hidden costs of fraud and abuse
C. PT-OT Metrics: image recognition for standardized physical performance evaluation
Hidden costs of undiagnosed or misdiagnosed medical needs (for PT/OT) and economic cost of lack of access to services for many people
D. Ocean/Beach Cleanup
Hidden costs of polution, habitat loss, invasive species, etc. 



## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
A. AI-Optimized Distaster-Relief Network-Protocol
- that the current EM spectrum use model is the only / best possible one

B. Educational and Institutional Best Practice Metrics and Protocols
- that standards and protocols don't matter
- that progress cannot be operationally defined
- that eithcs cannot be operationally defined
- that education isn't important and that workplace fraud and abuse are so small as to be ignored


C. PT-OT Metrics: image recognition for standardized physical performance evaluation
That most people don't need help, and that inexact metrics are good enough.

D. Ocean/Beach Cleanup
That knowing about the flow of beach polution won't help with cleanup


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
A good example for this may be Steven Pinker's recent book:
https://www.amazon.com/Enlightenment-Now-Science-Humanism-Progress/dp/0525427570
as it is both an admirable attempt with partial success but also a problematic narrative that lacks clear hypotheses and questions.

In the 'success' area, this book gather and communicates a great amount of data to show, for example, that much general news reporting about various specific aspects of the world is highly inaccurate (or at least does not match with available data). 

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
I am in the process of, as a hobby, rewriting the book so that it does not mix childish insults with important discussions. 

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
I would focus on questions and claims and reach more in some areas, and dwell less on reifications. 


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
In terms of the effective parts, maybe yes...but the style was the most problematic part of the work. 
So 'style' is problematic here. 


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
For each project the data may be in interestingly different places.

A. AI-Optimized Distaster-Relief Network-Protocol
maybe raw satelite data
maybe some urban traffic studies
self-driving car data may contain similar traffic sets
B. Educational and Institutional Best Practice Metrics and Protocols
hmmmm....
C. PT-OT Metrics: image recognition for standardized physical performance evaluation
privacy is maybe a topic here
Academic, e.g.
https://academic.oup.com/ptj/pages/videos
D. Ocean/Beach Cleanup
a combination of 
- scraping social media (vacation pics)
- satelite data
- orgaization such as greenpeas and nat.geo may have data for students to look at...


# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
