# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
*I truly care about healthcare, population health, and mitigating healthcare spending. Healthcare spending is increasing drastically, from year to year. We are also seeing that the amount of money that is being spent, can often be avoided. Money is being spent to treat patients who are readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of being discharged (for the same or similar reason). This speaks to lack of proper treatment during the hospital stay OR lack of appropriate follow-up care. There are also a number of other factors that could potentially impact the readmission rates of certain patients. For example, demographics (race, socioeconomic status, current chronic conditions, insurance status, etc.) or overall understanding of how to navigate the healthcare industry.*

What do you know about?
*As evidence by my narrative above, I have quite a few years in the healthcare industry. I know about the poicies and politics and their potential impact on the patients.*

What decisions do you face?
*I am faced with decisions that involve me figuring out what to do with the information once I have it. I know that hospitals are constantly looking for ways to save money...knowing which patients are most likely to be readmitted to their hospital would potentially save them millions of dollars annually. But I am also an advocate for the patient. I would like for this information to be used to provide better interventions for these high-risk patients sooner. There are a number of models that have been shown to be successful in decreasing hospital readmissions AND misuse/abuse of the ED. Having a predictive model, derived from the data of hospitals across the country, could help identify which patients could benefit from additional resources to prevent readmission into the hospital, misuse and abuse of the ED.*

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
*I could absolutely apply geographic variation to my topic. While there is a general problem with overutilization in the hospital as it relates to hospital readmissions and ED misuse and abuse, there are some geographic factors that also contribute to this problem as well.*

2. Trend related to the news
*There would definitely be a trend as it relates to the news, because this problem is also a source of a lot of political tension. There are so many discussions about universal healthcare (universal Medicare), no penalties for being uninsured, making sure health plans cover the essential health benefits, Medicaid expansion, etc. These political topics, often covered by news outlets, will likely have an impact.*

3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about
*This is definitely answering a question that most health plans, hospitals, physicians, ACOs, and CMS would care about.*

5. Valuable to businesses
*Because hospitals are currently penalized for having readmissions, and the government is overspending on healthcare with decreasing health outcomes, there are a number of stakeholders that would find this information valuable as it could save 10s of millions of dollars for them (depending on what type of stakeholder you are).*

6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
*I think the biggest misconception about this topic is that readmissions, misuse/abuse of the ED are occuring because patients truly couldn't or didn't get better.*

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
*data.gov , healthdata.gov , state repositories for hospital discharge data.*
