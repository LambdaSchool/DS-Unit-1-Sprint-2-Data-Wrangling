# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

* What do you care about?

Foundations of Mathematics, Linguistics, Formal Verification, Programming Languages and their implementation, 

* What do you know about?

Foundations of Mathematics and Programming languages, a little Japanese, many different programming languages, and how to implement some paradigms.

* What decisions do you face?

Personal financial/investment decisions.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

Distribution of linguistic structures across regions.
Focus of research topics in mathematics across regions.
Popularity of different languages by place.

2. Trend related to the news

How do/should investment strategies change as markets perform better or worse?

3. Who does that?

Demographics across different fields of mathematics/linguistics.

4. Answering a question people care about

???

5. Valuable to businesses

If at all, how much additional income/savings for businesses can be attributed to switching from one programming language to another.

6. What's the most popular?

Most popular programming language over time

7. Cost/Money rankings



## Misconceptions

* What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

That mathematics is about numbers. That there is a single, canonical foundation for mathematics.

That every programming language is basically the same with different syntax (this is only kind of true within paradigms, but utterly untrue across)

## Examples

* What data storytelling example inspires you?

None of them did. Some of them were interesting, but none of them were inspirational.

But, for the sake of this assignment, I'll pick this one:

* Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

Maybe, but no.

* Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

Sure, but I'm not.

* Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

Yes, it does some interesting things with maps and categorical data. I particularly like the zoom-able map. Just about any geographic question could benefit from that kind of visualization, and my dataset does have geographic elements.

Another interesting one:
https://priceonomics.com/which-car-brands-have-the-most-and-least-loyal/

It provides a few examples of some of the more common ways of graphing categorical data using percentages. That could be useful since I'm dealing primarily with categorical data.

## Data

* Where could you search for data about your topic?

I *did* find my data by on data.world by searching for "language difficulty rating dataset". My other dataset was found by remembering the World Atlas of Language Structures, and searching for its database as a downloadable file.

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
