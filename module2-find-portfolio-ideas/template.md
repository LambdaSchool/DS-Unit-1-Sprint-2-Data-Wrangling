# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?

- environmental issues
- economic inequality
- anthropology
- (I really care about when humans can migrate to some other planets, e.g. Mars.)  
...  
- tiny house movement  

What do you know about?

- The tiny house community is growing. Most people chose tiny house for economic reasons, e.g. job, savings, family size, location, etc. It would be interesting to find connections between each other. However a lot of tiny houses are built to bypass local zoning regulations etc., usually they don't count as houses, so it is hard to gather data about it.
