# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?

1) Running performance
2) Adblocking usage

What do you know about?
1) Several schools are known to have better cross country runners. But why?
2) Adblocker usage has soared over the past five years. What's the main cause behind this trend?

What decisions do you face?
1) Best way to train for run?
2) Should I enable my adblocker?

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
- Overall running times of teams based on location (environment, culture)

2. Trend related to the news
- Chrome's decision to alter their API that impacts adblockers

3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about


5. Valuable to businesses
- User engagement to sites based on the amount of ads

6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
- Wealthier communities have faster runners. Not sure if true, who knows?
- Adblocking always causes companies to lose money. Might not necessarily be the case, who knows?

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
- https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/twitter-data-shows-major-increase-gaming-engagement-platform-1230240
- Article asks about why more people are more engaged with games. Suggests that the #VideoGamesAreNottoBlame trend is the cause.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
- Is it because gaming is becoming more accessible over the years?

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
- What games are more talked about on Twitter?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
- Maybe. I'd probably try to use graphs and talk more about the facts.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
- I've been trying to search for data on the Data is Plural spreadsheet.
