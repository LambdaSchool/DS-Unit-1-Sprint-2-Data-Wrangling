# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
    A. Food

    B. Parts of Medicine

What do you know about?
    A. I know that I like food and that I have tried many different types of foods. I have access to different types of food in my city     and I know many of the customs/history surrounding the foods that I eat.
  
    B.I have taken some courses in physiology because I have always been fascinated by medicine. Medicine is a very broad field spanning     many sectors, and there are so many different questions that need to be analyzed and solved.

What decisions do you face?
    A. I have to decide what every meal I eat is. Whether I want to try a new cuisine or eat something I've already had. Whether I want     to cook or order out. If I cook, what and how? There are a lot of decisions to be made surrounding food.
  
    B. Regarding medicine, I'd have to decide what side I'd like to analyze. There's diagnostics, procedural outcomes, patient care,         administrative analytics, and a whole bunch more. 

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
    A. How many different types of restaurants are in a given city; perhaps compare that to the cultural make-up of the city
    
    B. Comparing the most common reasons for hospital visits in different regions of the country

2. Trend related to the news
    A. The number of fast food chains popping up each year and how it affects consumer habits
    
    B. The number of deaths caused due to problems with access to healthcare

3. Who does that?
    A. The number of people who eat a certain type of cuisine compared to other cuisines on a given day

    B. How many doctors decide to live and practice in the same city they did their residency in 
    
4. Answering a question people care about
    A. How many options of restaurants people go through before deciding on the one they want
    
    B. Tracking different reasons for hospitalizations on different days of the week

5. Valuable to businesses
    A. Dishes that are most popular to consumers in a given area
    
    B. A comparison of those who are insured or uninsured and how much patients need to pay for certain procedures

6. What's the most popular?
    A. The most popular singular dish in various regional cuisines
    
    B. The most popular field in medicine according to med school students

7. Cost/Money rankings
    A. Which fast food restaurant makes the most money in a given time period
    
    B. The salary of doctors compared to how much tuition they paid for med school
    

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
  A. Food allergies and food intolerances are the same. However, the former involves the immune system and can have life altering         implications, whereas the latter involves mostly the digestive system and may not be life threatening at all.
  
  B. You cannot break a fever by wrapping yourself in blankets. It's an old wives' tale. The reason you feel cold after a fever is         because you are either in the process of breaking it or have already broken it.


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
I'm leaning towards an example in medicine. Perhaps the one where we analyze the reasons for hospitalizations on different days of the week.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Yes; the weekend is not as popular for hospitalizations as some of the weekdays

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Do different hospitals receive more patients due to their proximity to downtown/different neighborhoods, and on which days?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Which cuisine of food do people like to eat on different days of the week

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
I would try the UCI repo or search different hospital websites

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
