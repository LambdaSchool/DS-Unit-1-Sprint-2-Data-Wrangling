## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics?

_([1] is idea / topic #1, same thing goes for [2] = #2)_
1. Geographic Variation
    - [1] Not really, unless collecting data on crop production(etc) and is used in the same way on multiple farm operations. (_e.g. which 'area's' farms(even more specific of an area) are taking in the most revenue, based off of product similarity_) 
    - [2] Yes very much so, people cover this planet _like_ a plague. We ARE the DATA!! ðŸ¤£ We can see if people from ___ are at risk for ___ based of of their diet, activity level / other, and compare them to one another, seeing where is the healthiest etc.

2. Trend related to the news
    - [1] Could apply, positive conversation promotes understanding and acceptance, Could make the topic boom(_popular_)
    - [2] Another very much so, could be because of some products that got popular(_for flavor, and it being ethically positive_), this topic will be in the news more and more as it has been growing in popularity and showing up there already.

3. Who does that?
    - [1] Yes this can be applied, based on customers purchase history you can see and compare _who_(demographic(not private information)), what(item), and when(time scale).
    - [2] Yes, with a proper dataset we would be able to see who(demographic), and region. As just about everyone: eats(in some form), drinks(again, in some form), and can move around(3rd time, again in some form). Making it somewhat easy to target this industry for capital growth.

4. Secret data answering a question people care about
    - [1] yes it applies, it could improve crop yields, water usage, power bills, etc. This secret data would have to be found before being utalized properly, but with that said Im sure there are secret data points that have yet to be found. This makes it valuable to the higher ups who want to make a profit from their fields. Maybe something they arn't doing yet, but their competition might, forces improvement, or failure.
    - [2] Yes. We are learning about new things in health, nutrition, etc. all the time! This makes the health industry scrounge for the next 'quick buck' as they usually dont want whats best for the consumer but what ever will make them the most money quickist(its the point of their business, to make the company money). Hidden or secret data could open up a new subset-_like_ market of the original.

5. Valuable to businesses
    - [1] Yes. I've stated above that essentually the market for these products is growing, and a good portion of people with an opinion on this topic would agree with me that it is most likely not going to slow down(drastically, it will continue to grow)) for _some time_.
    - [2] Yes. If you know what _people_ are eating, and how much working out etc. you can then try and target those demographics to sell your products too.

6. What's the most popular?
    - [1] Yes. (again) Which farms sell the most product to the consumer(aka its the most popular), and from this you can either make more, improve it to sell more, or for more.
    - [2] yes. What is the most or least popular 'health food' that company 'a' sells.

7. Cost/Money rankings
    - [1] Yes. (_simple answer, I feel I have answered this better throughout the above sections for_ [1])
    - [2] Yes.
    
(_I hope this layout format isnt too difficult to understand when it comes to my splintered responces_)

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
- [1] The dangers of cannabis use, and the effects on the human body/psyche. In reality it is a __lot less__ _scary_ than the typical 'drugs are bad', or saying that cannabis has a causality role in trying other drugs, or a 'gateway drug'. (really complex topic, too much for this assignment alone)
- [2] that 'good health' is built in the gym or anywhere thats not your kitchen. The opposite is true, where do you get abs? The kitchen. Essentually you can't be healthy with a bad diet, your body knows what it needs, instead most fill it with junk. 

## Examples
