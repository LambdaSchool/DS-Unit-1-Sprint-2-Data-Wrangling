## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Conspicuous Consumption - Huge variations between urban centers and suburban communities, let alone rural areas
Educational Issues - Same as above
Paid television - Differences in service availbility and quality could greatly affect the data
Job Hunt/House Hunt 

2. Trend related to the news
Black representation - "Oscars so white"
Educational Issues - Teachers on strike
Gun Ownership - Mass shootings (unfortunately) regularly dominate the news cycle
Healthy food - "First Eggs were bad, now they're good"

3. Who does that?
Conspicuous Consumption - Literally the reason behind this marketting template
Gun Ownership - There may or may not be huge differences between different racial demographics as it pertains to this topic

4. Answering a question people care about
Paid Television - Who wants to pay for cable
Video Games - There are ton of questions that parents have about games for their children

5. Valuable to businesses
Exercise - imagine the marketting bonanza
Healthy food - Imagine all the cook books
Paid Tv - Netflix would love me
Job Hunt/House Hunt - I could invent a Trulia/Zillow filter
Video Games - Again, think of the marketting 

6. What's the most popular?
Combat Sports
Pro Wrestling
Black Representation
Video Games
Exercise
Healthy Food

7. Cost/Money rankings

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
The Simpsons Example inspires me. Looking at something I enjoy through the lens of Data Science, and haing it ACTUALLY produce useful results, would be AWESOME.
Also, The Three Second Problem on "The Pudding". Just the fact that their rubric could be applied to any number of different NBA non-calls, or even overly frequent called infractions (James Harden's Stepback)

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?{Would like some clarification}


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
Sales and subscription data is readily available. For the topics on Cable/Satelite Service, and Black representation I would be able to find the necessary data from the companies in question.

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.
1)Is Cable/Satelite Service an expense that the average household should pay for?
2)Should Media companies invest more in projects centered around black characters?

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question? {Would like some clarification}
1)
2)

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
1) Are the Alternatives to cable/satelite services available and cost effective enough to replace them?
2) Is the lack of black main characters negatively affecting the consumption of media?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
1) Does the average person need a personal computer anymore, or is a smartphone/tablet enough?
2) Should the National Republican party seek more diversity in the political candidates that it endorses

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.

I'm leaning towards the Cable/Satelite Service topic. I feel that analysis I would do would be more useful to the everyday person
Also, the topic has more broad appeal.
