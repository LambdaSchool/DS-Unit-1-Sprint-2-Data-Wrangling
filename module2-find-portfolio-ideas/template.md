# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
-I'm interested in looking at long-term, cross-sectional trends in a museum's collection. 

What do you know about?
-A museum faces constraints on two fronts: a set budget to acquire artworks, finite space to archive what has been acquired (or donated). We can infer that looking into an archive can illuminate what a museum values as important art. 

What decisions do you face?
-Whether to use the Artworks.csv dataset or Artists.csv

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation


2. Trend related to the news


3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about


5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?
-This would be the most obvious application to the data. The dataset has columns like artist name, gender, nationality, media used, art categories, and even the dimensions of the art work. We can see the most popular categories of each (and least popular).

7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
-Because only a very small portion of the museum's archives are on display at any given moment, this is probably alot of misconceptions about what categories or artists dominate a museum's collection. 

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
-I enjoyed this from a fellow student: https://medium.com/@bundickm/the-secrets-of-catan-ed203a9a7c61

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
-I could a similar one, looking for what factors increase the likelihood of an artwork being acquired or donated to the musuem

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
-Yes, in an "unlocking the museum's archives" way

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
-I found a fairly clean dataset on Github: https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection
