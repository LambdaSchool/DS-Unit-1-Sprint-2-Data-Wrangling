# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?

I care about fun. I love playing, whether it's sports, gaming, reading something interesting, or anything stimulating!

What do you know about?

I know about how un-stimulating some work is. I come from finance, and I kick myself every day for not choosing to get a degree in CS. What's worse, finance is complicated on purpose. It's meant to make people think it's above their heads. It's not.

What decisions do you face?

My current data set has to do with college majors. It has a lot of interesting information. Most of it has to do with the earning potential tied to specific majors. I have a lot of opinions about this, but I hold them loosely because I'm willing to be shown that I'm wrong with the data
