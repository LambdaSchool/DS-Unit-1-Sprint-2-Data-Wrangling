# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about? Automation (drone systems, automotive systems) // face unlock systems


What do you know about? Aero Engineering background // image classifier systems off youtube


What decisions do you face? How to move in a 3D space? // Why does my face unlock system not work when I'm over exposed (I'm black and certainly not well trained) ?


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

Different weather conditions, different landscapes require diffrent drone builds and different functionality of the drones.

Lighting conditions // how many people use face unlock per region?

2. Trend related to the news

The advent of self-driving cars and need for new regulations, drone delivery tests in Singapore// Not suer

3. Who does that?

Consumer and business orientated // phone users

4. Answering a question people care about

Are drones/ self-driving cars safe? // is my phone secure?


5. Valuable to businesses

Is drone and automative automation R&D worth it? // does face unlock translate into more phone sales

6. What's the most popular?

Consumer drone company? // 


7. Cost/Money rankings

Cost effective self-driving system? // 

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

People wrongly believe that self-driving cars will take another 10 years before they hit the market.

Face unlock performs equally well on users of all skin shades.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

I prefer the seeing the data applied to beautiful means.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

Yes e.g. self-driving cars are already a safer option on the roads at night than their not automative counterparts.

Face unlock doesnt't work equally well for all users of all skin shades.


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

Most certainly yes.

Face unlock doesn't work in low light conditions

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

Most certainly yes.

Test how well an image classifier library works on people of all shades

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

Comma AI has open sourced their data so I could use that.

Hmmmm..

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
