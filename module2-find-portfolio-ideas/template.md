## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Changes in migration patterns related to climate change.
How pwople in each county tend to vote vs districts (getting an idea of gerrymandering).

2. Trend related to the news
Rain and flooding in the midwest leading up to the toxic algae blooms in Mississippi.
How people who voted for Trump feel towards the end of his term.

3. Who does that?
Who contributes to green tech the most.
Who votes most often.

4. Answering a question people care about
What has the biggest effect on the environment (what can I do to help the environment)
Is our current voting system truly representative of the population's general beliefs/values?

5. Valuable to businesses
Does going green improve sales and if so is it worth the cost.
How people tend to vote in each area in reference to policies important to businesses (affecting where it would be best to start/expand a business)

6. What's the most popular?
Most popular green tech among consumers
Who was the most loved/popular president of their time?

7. Cost/Money rankings
Cost of installing and maintaining alterrnative energy vs utility savings.
Most cost effective ways to campaign.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Climate change is fake.
it's too hard/expensive to go green.
My (one) vote doesn't matter.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
UNtapped Potential: Making the U.S. an energy leader

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Perhaps, despite the enormous potential, solar isn't the best way to go in converting the U.S. to renewable energy.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
How long will our non-renewable resources last/how fast do we need to find new power sources?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Energy requirements vs energy potential for each state.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
