# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

### What do you care about?

â‚¿) Bitcoin! And blockchain technology in general, as a means of solving coordination problems without having trusted authorities as a point of failure.

ðŸ’¸) Student debt is a serious, serious problem.

### What do you know about?

â‚¿) Cryptocurrencies in general, the general structure of blockchain protocols, and the different blockchain products currently available to the public.

ðŸ’¸) I read quite a bit about finance, and I'm generally pretty familiar with the world of debt instruments.

### What decisions do you face?

â‚¿) Choosing which product or project to invest or participate in within the space of blockchain projects is kind of fraught. If I buy bitcoin, am I just buying the oldest and least developed of the available protocols? If I buy an alt, am I just buying bitcoin with higher volatility? Measuring relative correlation brings valuable information to bear on this question.

ðŸ’¸) Is taking on debt for an education still a reasonable choice to make? When is it reasonable, when is it not?

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

ðŸ’¸) Could be done, but the angle to work would have to be clever. Universities vs trade schools, maybe, and their differing outcomes based on location.

2. Trend related to the news

â‚¿) Whenever there's been a big runup or crash the news has been happy to comment. And Bloomberg tends to make a comment whenever there's a notable movement.

ðŸ’¸) Student debt gets some news, but the angle taken tends to be pretty awful.

3. Who does that?

ðŸ’¸) Like the geographic variation angle, but likely better. What are the demographic characteristics of those holding debt?

4. Answering a question people care about


5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?

â‚¿) This certainly has a place in the discussion of relative correlation/anticorrelation and who's leading who.

ðŸ’¸) This could be taken to a place like "which degrees are most popular vs which have the best ROI?"

7. Cost/Money rankings

â‚¿) Pretty self-explanatory. Will I be better off just buying bitcoin or looking for an alt?

ðŸ’¸) Also pretty self-explanatory. Is student debt still a good financial decision?

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

â‚¿) "Cryptocurrencies are just for breaking the law, not for any *legitimate* purpose."
    Cryptocurrencies are useful whenever parties want a means of coordinating without a third party, not just moving money without oversight. Cash is a safer choice than bitcoin for your anonymity. Moreover, there are third parties to circumvent other than the law - credit rating agencies, insurers, social networks... the list goes on. 
    
ðŸ’¸) "You can eliminate/alleviate student loan debt by working through college"/"Taking loans for useless degrees is irresponsible!"/any other number of criticisms that don't actually change the figures.
    While a lot of these criticisms can have some varying degree of truth to them, and might serve as valid advice to someone who has not yet taken out loans, they don't change the world we live in. There is a certain amount of debt present, it will take a certain amount of effort and dedication of valuable resources that could be used elsewhere to pay it off. It will have downstream effects that need to be accounted for irrespective of whether there were better choices that could have been made earlier.


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

Bloomberg's [stories](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-minimum-wage-increase-inflation/?srnd=premium) tend to have great, interactive data visualizations.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

Rejecting the hypothesis would be saying something like "increases to the minimum wage aren't actually being eaten away by inflation" which would be quite hard to justify.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

Sure, something along the lines of whether or not the minimum wage increases labor-capital substitution or labor-labor substitution might be feasible.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

Sure - it might be quite interesting to do something on the real value in debt of student loans being eaten away by inflation.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

â‚¿) I've already messed around with the Coingecko API, and the API for one blockchain explorer. Coingecko is likely enough, and I can request API keys for exchanges as well.

ðŸ’¸) The Fed has some decent data for student loans - ROIs for degrees might be a bit more complicated, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics is likely to have something.

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
