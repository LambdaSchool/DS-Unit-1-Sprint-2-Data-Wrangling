# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?


What do you know about?
- Jujitsu
- English


What decisions do you face?
- How should I spend my time?
- How should I prioritize when I have multiple tasks?


## Seven templates - Martial Arts

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
- What region produces the best/most judo players?
- Where in the US are the most jujutsuka?

2. Trend related to the news
- Something related to quantifying a recent major judo competition (2020 Olympics?)

3. Who does that?
- Demographics of jujutsuka

4. Answering a question people care about
- How good is jujutsu as exercise?

5. Valuable to businesses
- Something about MMA pay-per-view, what competitor statistics lead to more sales?

6. What's the most popular?
- Most popular martial art (by age/location/gender?)

7. Cost/Money rankings
- Price of martial art classes/equipment


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
- nonsense about having to register your hands as a deadly weapon


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
- Could examine injuries, recovery, etc, across different arts


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
- Probably most sports


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
- https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results
- Inquire about membership stats from various dojo organizations


## Seven templates - Speedrunning

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
- Which runner nationalities dominate? Does this change over time? Depending on game nationality/platform?

2. Trend related to the news
- Cover games from last SGDQ or the upcoming AGDQ; new games

3. Who does that?
- Speedrunner demographics

4. Answering a question people care about
- How long does it take to get fast at a game?

5. Valuable to businesses
- Differences between frequently and infrequently run games might be relevant to developers hoping to create runner-friendly games?

6. What's the most popular?
- What games get run most? 

7. Cost/Money rankings
- Money raised by incentives for specific games at A/SGDQ; money raised during the runs of those games

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
- I'm not sure it's broadly discussed enough for there to be much misinformation


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
- Those cool animated videos of market share over time, but in reverse, watching numbers get smaller


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
- Could be about identifying "inflection points" when a new time-saving strat is implemented and spreads throughout the community


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
- Could follow the general shape of this idea with any kind of "race" data -- one could imagine sprinter data in such a graphic


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
- Scrape speedrun.com


# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.

- If I can bone up on scraping, especially if I get the tools for making those animated videos, I'm leaning toward the speedrunning one
