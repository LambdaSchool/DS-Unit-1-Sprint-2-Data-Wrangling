Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

I could do a new hypothesis for the same question, I believe GDP is a very large factor in suicides.

I can use a different dataset to answer the same questions as in the exploratory analysis of Dating Data.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

The Suicide Data exploration did not analyize the U.S specifically, so I can focus more on the U.S.

Since it was an exploratory analysis, they covered many questions. But there are still home that could be asked.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

I could use a different dataset for both, and I could answer less questions than both of the Exploratory Analysies I read.
## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

Kaggle, public records.

Kaggle, dating sites.
