What data  inspires you?
Honey Maid’s “This Is Wholesome”
Honey Maid’s “This Is Wholesome” spot features a variety of families and opens on two young fathers embracing their new baby. The ad currently has over 8.1 million views on YouTube.



“It’s about recognizing that the American family dynamic and look has changed over the decade,” Gary Osifchin, senior marketing director at Honey Maid owner Mondelez International Inc., said on Good Morning America. “And our product line has changed in parallel with that changing American family dynamic.”

Needless to say, plenty of hateful people did not support the gay, bi-racial, and otherwise alternative families presented in the ad, but Honey Maid was ready. In a follow up ad, simply called “Love,” Honey Maid documents how they took all of these online messages of hate and turned them into something more beautiful and powerful. The company claims to have received ten times as many positive messages than hateful ones, and the ad currently has over 4.3 million YouTube views. Talk about utilizing user-generated content! The campaign was designed by Droga5 and sent a clear message – love always outshines hate.
