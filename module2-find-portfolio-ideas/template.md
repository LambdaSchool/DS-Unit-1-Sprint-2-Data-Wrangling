## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation - How has general happiness levels increased/decreased with the rise of technology in different countries?
                        - In each country, what education style seems to be the most successful? 

2. Trend related to the news - Mass shooters using social media
                             - Children being taught by teachers who push their bias view on them


3. Who does that? - What type of person uses social media more?
                  - What politcal party pushes their views more?


4. Answering a question people care about
    How can we improve happiness?
    How can we better educate our children?


5. Valuable to businesses - Knowing happiness levels based upon rises and falls of technology may conclude a more profitable social network system.
                          - A successful education system could be very profitable


6. What's the most popular? - Which social media network is most used and what are the levels of happiness of users on each platform
                            - Which teaching style is most popular
    
7. Cost/Money rankings - Has the cost of technology increased?
                       - Has the cost of education increased?
                       
## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic? - People may assume all technology is bad and causes people to be sad
                                                     - People assume homeschooled students do not have any social skills

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you? - How Machines Destroy/Create Jobs
                                             

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question? - The middle class disapearing with the rise of technology


Could you do a new question, for the same topic? - Are new jobs created when machines replace jobs?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"? - Where are jobs being replaced by machines


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic? - kaggle datasets and this .gov site on mental health:                                                                                      https://www.mentalhealth.gov/basics/what-is-mental-health
                                                  - kaggle datasets and 
                                                     https://www.edweek.org/ew/issues/education-statistics/index.html
