## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics?

1. Geographic Variation
 - google queries per capita in US counties
 - AI risk conferences by country (hosted, funded)

2. Trend related to the news
 - Language around use of force and civil rights in ICE/BP handbook
 - Are weather forecasts getting less accurate in the past couple decades?

3. Who does that?

4. Answering a question people care about


5. Valuable to businesses
 - Outlier detection in the Enron dataset
   - Can we measure entropy in the information theory sense based on NLP?
 - Test the Teodoris (2018) conclusion on generalists using other data
 - Fragility of knowledge bases?

6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings
 - Tenured philosophy positions and paper citation numbers

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
- Almost everyone underestimates existential risk.
- Social elites probably underrate generalists.


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
- A lot of stuff from SlateStarCodex.com:  https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/05/14/age-gaps-and-birth-order-effects/

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
- Check the general distribution of sibling ages. It probably differs significantly from the one shown in his results.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
- Does personality correlate with birth order?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
I usually go straight to google's dataset search. But there are a lot of options.
