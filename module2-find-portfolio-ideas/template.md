# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
Renewable energy, history, storytelling, comparative economics.

What do you know about?
A little bit about all four.

What decisions do you face?
Coming up with a compelling enough story, and finding the data that I need to come up with a hypothesis, without overshooting the project beyond my current capabilities.

For the project, I'm playing with the idea of writing it on, "The fall of American technological dominance?"

The data I will be using will from Higher Learning Institutions' yearly spending on Research and Development, how much they receive from the Federal Government, as well as the number of doctorates that graduate from these institutions on a yearly basis.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Yes, since the top universities in R&D spending are found throughout the USA.

2. Trend related to the news
With $1.5 Trillion in oustanding student debt in all of U.S., the idea of the University diploma as the pathway to the American dream has been tarnished.  However -- there are other reasons why Universities are integral to the U.S.: R&D spending.

3. Who does that?
The data is focused on university spend on R&D in the USA.

4. Answering a question people care about
As mentioned, the student loan bubble is massive.  From a "feel good" perspective, maybe not as relevant as a topic on Renewable Energy -- but everyone has been affected, or knows relatives and friends that are affected by the student loan debt crisis.

Also, we're constantly bombarded on the news regarding China's looming threat to U.S. hegemony (see Huawei ban by the Trump administration) -- maybe this information will glean some insights on how credible those threats are.

5. Valuable to businesses
From a branding perspective for Universities, this information would definitely be helpful.  And I'm sure it is content that each individual University already promotes on some level.

6. What's the most popular?
It will be interesting to see whether the "best universities" that people have in mind also results in a similar list with regards to their spending the most in R&D.

I think we'll see some bigger State universities in their due to the nature of their receiving a lot of funding from the Federal government.

7. Cost/Money rankings
This project will definitely involve some of the cost/money rankings that we constantly see over social media.  People like lists.  


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
I don't think the average American considers exactly how much our Universities spend in funding for R&D.  And how much of a role they play in technological development.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
A few!  One of the ones that stick out was an animated maps on the extent of certain empires throught history.  That was pretty cool to see the timelines of their existence, and their rise and fall.  

Heatmaps of renewable energy installations also are fascinating to me -- we're living in a transitional period from coal to renewables.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Over time, spending in research and development has declined relative to our country's GDP.  

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
For my topic?  Yes, sure.  I could also ask: Has there been a relative decline of Science and Tech in America's culture?  And see if that is true.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Yep -- seems like it could be applied to an endless number of different topics!

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
I found my data set at the National Science Foundation (https://ncsesdata.nsf.gov)
Also, a dataset which I will add as necessary is the amount of endowments each university has to this date (Nacubo, https://www.nacubo.org/Research/2019/Historic-Endowment-Study-Data).
I was also able to get info on USA's military spending, as a contrast to our academic spending (World Bank, https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.TOTL.TF.ZS?end=2017&start=1991).  

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
It was either this topic, or a topic on renewable energy.  But -- since I have not yet specified exactly what I want to do for my topic in renewables, I decided to move forward with this topic for now.
