## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Metro sizes and financial status
Not every city has a pro football team
2. Trend related to the news
Which team will be predicted to be the best?

3. Who does that?
Sports analysts
Sports commentary
Sports Executives
Sports Agents
4. Answering a question people care about
Will Carson Wentz be the MVP for 2019 because Louis Riddick says so?
Is there data that is quantifiable that can back up his claim from past predictions he has made?

5. Valuable to businesses
Sports Betting
Market share
Team Gear sales
Promotional Sponsorships

6. What's the most popular?
Weekly rankings and speculation on who is the best team/player etc.

7. Cost/Money rankings
If Carson Wentz is signified as the best will more people attend games in Philadelphia and other markets in away games?
Will more jerseys be sold?
Will more Eagles merchandise be sold?
Will more money be made?

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
There is nothing to analyze in football or that it is a boring sport.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Are there sets of data to improve the predictability of football games?

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Is there a correlation of how well a football team does by the GDP of the city it occupies?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Is there a higher demand for houses in a place where the median is at a certain level that causes higher housing prices? (2 times the poverty income rate?
