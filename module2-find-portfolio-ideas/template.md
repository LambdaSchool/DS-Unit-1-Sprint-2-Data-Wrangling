# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

### What do you care about?

₿) Bitcoin! And blockchain technology in general, as a means of solving coordination problems without having trusted authorities as a point of failure.

### What do you know about?

₿) Cryptocurrencies in general, the general structure of blockchain protocols, and the different blockchain products currently available to the public.

### What decisions do you face?

₿) Choosing which product or project to invest or participate in within the space of blockchain projects is kind of fraught. If I buy bitcoin, am I just buying the oldest and least developed of the available protocols? If I buy an alt, am I just buying bitcoin with higher volatility? Measuring relative correlation brings valuable information to bear on this question.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation


2. Trend related to the news

₿) Whenever there's been a big runup or crash the news has been happy to comment. And Bloomberg tends to make a comment whenever there's a notable movement.

3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about


5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?

₿) This certainly has a place in the discussion of relative correlation/anticorrelation and who's leading who.

7. Cost/Money rankings

₿) Pretty self-explanatory. Will I be better off just buying bitcoin or looking for an alt?
