# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?

The applications data science has for various businesses and their relation to employees as well as clients

What do you know about?

I know about luxury transportation like limousines. I know about the restaurant industry. I studied 4 years of Hospitality and Tourism in high school and Business administration in college for my associate. I have a great understanding of customer service both in casual and high end settings.

What decisions do you face?

I face the decision of going deeper into these 2 industries I have worked in for the past 5 years and applying the knowledge I'm learning. Or finding another practical business application I can use data science for.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

### Limousines in Miami

1. Geographic Variation

What area do most people book Limousines from in Miami. Can use zip codes to figure this out.

2. Trend related to the news

Everyoen is talking about Uber and Lyft and how this industry is affecting Taxis. There is not a lot of talk about how Uber is affecting Luxury Transportation in the mainstream news. But it was a relevant topic for Limousine company owners when Uber became the norm for daily commutes as it did affect the limousine industry until the market stabilized.

3. Who does that?

The people who use Luxury transportation/ limousines vary in income levels and because of that also per occasion. Middle to high income might use the service for every birthday or special outings amongst family members. Rich people use this service often and can vary from daily use to every week or every time they travel outside the city. Low income people will only use this service once or twice in their lifetime (maybe for a wedding or a to try it out).

4. Answering a question people care about

How much money relative to the zip code is spent on limousines every year for a small to medium sized limousine company in Miami.

5. Valuable to businesses

Being able to put a value on how much a given zip code in Miami is worth will allow limousine companies to allocate to more targeted marketing for higher earning potential.

6. What's the most popular?

The zip code that has the highest spending on luxury transportation.

7. Cost/Money rankings

What zip code has the highest earning potential in relation to the marketing that can be done to target them.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

People might think Limousines only refer to stretch cars and party buses(this side of the industry is referred to as retail) when in reality the industry is also made up of other areas of luxury transportation that can refer to corporate.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

I can get the data for this topic from the company I use to work for here in Miami. The owner is my brother and I think he would support me if I can also relay some useful information back to him with the data he shared with me. This data should go back about 8 years.


### Small Boutique Peruvian Style Restaurants

1. Geographic Variation

This type of restaurant will have varying degrees of success depending on location. The factors within location that will affect customer perception can be: are there other restaurants of this type that have been succesful, percentage of people who eat out on a daily basis, and weekly potential spending based on income levels.

2. Trend related to the news

Some recent reports show that people are spending more money now than ever on food that is not prepared at home. Uber Eats and Postmates might have a big influence on this but the trends also show that people of the younger generation know less about cooking than previous generations.

3. Who does that?

tracking growth based on the return of this kind of restaurant over a period of several years to be able to predict if the restaurant needs additional marketing, less inventory on any given day of the year, or a different appeal for it's target demograhic.

4. Answering a question people care about

How many of a given item does the restaurant need for every day it operates. How much money does a company needs to spend on marketing to achieve a steady increase in recurrent clientele. How do changes in the menu (ex. quality of products, change in providers) affect the customers buying habbits.

5. Valuable to businesses

Being able to predict how much inventory is needed for the working week will lower the amount of food that is over stock. Being able to predict what effect the money that is spent on marketing will have on the steady increase of clientele over a period of time. Being able to predict when to change an item on the menu based on the effect a higher or lower quality product has on sales volume.

6. What's the most popular?

Being able to lower the negative effects of overstock can greatly increase a big topic in the restaurant indistry.

7. Cost/Money rankings

overstock, and marketing can have a big impact on the revenue potential of a small boutique Peruvian Restaurant. Quality of the products versus the perception of the customer can vary widely and can have different effects on the customer base.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

A misonception that people might have about Small Boutique Peruvian Style Restaurants is to what they are. A boutique restaurant can be a whole in the wall that has incredible food. They can have a very hip style that is very attractive to first time customers. They can also be perceived to be very popular for the younger crowd since they might not be the "big fancy restaurant" the older crowd might like to go to on a Friday/ Saturday night.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

I should be able to get this data from my previous workplace, the bosses are friends with my family and I worked at this restaurant from the day it opened 2 years ago to now. I saw it grow in this time and is now opening 2 more restaurants with the same concept here in Miami. If I can turn this information into something useful I should be able to also relay useful findings back to them.
