## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

Using the 1901 and 1911 census data for Ireland, I can compare residents in different townlands. Given the information provided on the census forms, I should be able to create vizualizations of differences in religion, education, family size, mortality, occupation, and place of birth.

I could use data on the ideological lean of Supreme Court justices to see if there is any interesting correlation between home state and ideology, and how that changes over time.

2. Trend related to the news

I could compare the 1901 and 1911 census data to regional data about the Brexit vote to see if there are any interesting correlations.

I could see if historical data on the Supreme Court could be used to make predictions about how the court will rule on coming cases.

3. Who does that?

Not really relevant.

4. Answering a question people care about

I might be able to use the census data to see if there is any interesting correlation between name and occupational outcome - are certain names more common in certain professions, and are certain professions more likely for people with certain names?

5. Valuable to businesses

Not really relevant.

6. What's the most popular?

I could use census data to find the most common first names and surnames in each geographic region, and amongst each religious community.

I could try to identify the justice other justices are most likely to agree with at any given time - this could be thought of as the most popular justice at any given time.

7. Cost/Money rankings

While the census data does not include direct information about income, I might be able to use information about the house people live in to get a rough estimate of relative wealth.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

Not sure what people think about my topic.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

This is a good project:

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
