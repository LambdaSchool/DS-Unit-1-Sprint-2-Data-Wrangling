## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 
Topic 1: Skydiving accidents
Topic 2: Professional shogi winrates

1. Geographic Variation
a.Safety practices and standards definitely vary by location.
b.Could look at origins of players

2. Trend related to the news
a.News about skydiving accidents is usually sensationalist and inaccurate.
b.The rise and fall of important players is newsworthy.

3. Who does that?
a.Thrillseekers, divided into those who do it regularly and those who do it once or twice in their life.
b.Nerds, but also general audience

4. Answering a question people care about
a.People definitely care about whether they live or die.
b.People care a lot about how age relates to performance

5. Valuable to businesses
a.Safe dropzones will be more popular, less safe ones will be pressured to improve.
b.Perhaps in choosing players to sponsor

6. What's the most popular?
a.Do popularity and safety correlate?
b.Is x popular player the best ever at their age?

7. Cost/Money rankings
a.Can also see if there's a correlation between price and safety.
b.Who loses a lot but still makes lots of money?

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
a. Skydiving is a lot safer than it is generally made out to be.
b.Even if someone defeats a strong player, doesn't necessarily mean they're better.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

I like the dialect map in the NYT.
Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

Hypothesis: The regional dialects reflect different historical patterns of settlement and communication.
Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

How do dialects change over time?
Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

Anything that is based on regional differences.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
a.From the USPA, and the dropzone incident forum.
b.There are at least some datasets online about shogi.

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
