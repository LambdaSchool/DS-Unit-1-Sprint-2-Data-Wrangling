# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards working on for your project week.

NFL article has a higher percentage of going viral than a jeopardy one. Both require scrapping websites although jeopardy involves only scrapping one. I'm leaning towards NFL data because I want to know the answer for myself!
