# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?


What do you know about?


What decisions do you face?


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation


2. Trend related to the news


3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about


5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?


# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.

I care about a lot of things, but the overlap between things I care about and things with lots of data available is significantly smaller. Economics and biology are two fields I have taken amateur interest in which produce lots of data.

Topic #1: African economic history
Template: Geographic variation
Misconceptions: While it is correct that Africa is the poorest continent overall, many people think of African poverty as both static and homogeneous. In fact, there is a great deal of variation in African economic situations across space and time.
Examples: The topic is broad enough for a vast array of possible hypotheses. The data I found focuses on inflation and debt as major factors that cause crises, but there is other data out there that could focus on other statistics. Of course, a similar analysis could be performed on any continent.

Data: Current dataset is https://www.kaggle.com/chirin/africa-economic-banking-and-systemic-crisis-data/activity which is a subset of https://www.hbs.edu/behavioral-finance-and-financial-stability/data/Pages/global.aspx.

Topic #2: Gold reserves over time
Template: Geographic variation
Misconceptions: Many people are unaware that many countries still have large reserves of gold, even under modern fiat currency.
Examples: There are a broad variety of possible hypotheses as countries can be binned into many different regions and eras. If data can be found, similar analyses could be performed on oil reserves or other strategic resources.
Data: Dataset found at https://www.kaggle.com/eliasdabbas/gold-reserves-by-country-quarterly/downloads/gold-reserves-by-country-quarterly.zip/1. More data can be found as the hypothesis is developed as the dataset is rather skimpy, lacking any historical context such as wars, regime changes etc that occcured at various times.
