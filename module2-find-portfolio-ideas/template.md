## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
   Topic 1 = Music Therapy - Where is it required for the therapist to be certified?
   Topic 2 = Low income housing - Where is the most low income housing available?

2. Trend related to the news
   Topic 1 = School shootings related to mental health issues.
   Topic 2 = Homeless camps in the Denver Metro area

3. Who does that?
   Topic 1 = Music Therapists
   Topic 2 = Police, politicians

4. Answering a question people care about
   Topic 1 = How do we address mental health issues in at-risk youth?
   topic 2 = Housing and human rights

5. Valuable to businesses
   Topic 1 = Provides a new method of therapy in schools.
   Topic 2 = Keeps the homeless from gathering around a persons business.

6. What's the most popular?

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
   Topic 1 = People listen to music to deal with mental health issues.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

Several of the data story telling examples on Priceonomics are inspiring to me. I really liked the article on "Where People Spend the Most (and Least) on Rent in America?

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

Homelessness is higher in places where rents are higher.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

Is homelessness more prominent in states where rents are higher?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

Where are the highest and lowest levels of homelessness in America?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

Government Data Sights.
