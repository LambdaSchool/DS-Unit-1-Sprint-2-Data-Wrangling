# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
Topic A:  Improving quality of healthcare and access to healthcare service.
Topic B:  Improving healthcare delivery performance by providers

What do you know about?
Topic A:  My knowledge and experience is in technology, clinical medicine, and business.
Topic B:  My knowledge and experience is in technology, clinical medicine, and business.

What decisions do you face?
Topic A:  How to best leverage my background to make use of data science.
Topic B:  How to have the most impact on healthcare delivery.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Topic A:  Comparing the quality of diabetes care in various urban areas.
Topic B:  Assessing variations in the treatment protocol for colon cancer in various parts of the U.S.

2. Trend related to the news
Topic A:  Looking at the rate of uninsurance with respect to healthcare in the last 20 years.
Topic B:  How healthcare delivery performance has been impacted by the Affordable Care Act.

3. Who does that?
Topic A:  Identifying who has the best outcomes for the management of colon cancer.
Topic B:  Who is most predisposed to make use of clinical decision support tools.

4. Answering a question people care about
Topic A:  Finding which disease is associated with the highest mortality rates.
Topic B:  Identifying the amount of improvement in care when providers use clinical decision supprt.

5. Valuable to businesses
Topic A:  Identifying which treatment protocol for breast cancer provides the highest 5 year survival rate.
Topic B:  Finding the impact of the use of clniical decision support tools on provider ratings.

6. What's the most popular?
Topic A:  Finding the most popular treatment for prostate cancer and seeing if it is the same as the most effective treatment for prostate cancer.
Topic B:  Identifying the most popular topics incorporated into clinical decision support.

7. Cost/Money rankings
Topic A:  Identifying the least expensive, but effective, approach for managing stroke.
Topic B:  Finding the impact of the use of clniical decision support tools on cost of care.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Topic A:  Low cost case cannot be quality care.
Topic B:  Use of clinical decision support tools leads to impersonalized medicine.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
Topic A:  A demonstration of how the Vital Signs recommendations could be operationalized at the community level and how the measures can be used by key stakeholders to shape planning processes that lead to health improvement and health equity (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6170151/)
Topic B:  An investigation of how clinicians make a heart pump implant decision with a focus on how to best integrate an intelligent DST into their work process (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5101017/) 

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Topic A:  I could look at factors other than healthy people (also referred to as population health), quality of health care, cost of health care, and engagement.
Topic B:  I could look at whether the age of the provider affects how clinicians make a Topic B:   implant decision using an intelligent DST 

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Topic A:  I could demonstrate how the Vital Signs recommendations impact quality of care at the community level.
Topic B:  I could examine how clinicians make a decision as to whether to implant a coronary stent using an intelligent DST 

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Topic A:  I could demonstrate how the "Choosing Wisely" recommendations have lead to improved delivery of care.
Topic B:  I could compare the performance of intelegent DST systems that are used to implant a heart pump.  

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
Topic A:  The Dartmouth Atlas Project (https://www.dartmouthatlas.org/)
Topic B:  Heart implant data from May 2002 to December 2011, collected for patients from six UK centres(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK261276/)

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
I am leaning toward Topic B
