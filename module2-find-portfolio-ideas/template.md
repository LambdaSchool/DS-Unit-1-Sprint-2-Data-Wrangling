# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?


What do you know about?


What decisions do you face?


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation


2. Trend related to the news


3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about


5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?


# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.

# Global Average Temperature Data
https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/normals/1981-2010/
1. Geographic Variation
  It's information from stations all around the globe so I can use it to identify any changes around the globe.

2. Trend related to the news
  Obviously climate change is big news in political news lately with the Green New Deal being discussed in congress but I'd argue it is bigger in scientific news as those who study the data can see the alarming trends.

3. Who does that?
  I'd like to provide an analysis that the average person who doesn't understand climate change can use to begin to understand the data that is leading us to 

4. Answering a question people care about
  I'd hope people care about climate change as it is the single largest threat facing our society currently and hopefully I can create visualizations that help illuminate the issue to more people.

5. Valuable to businesses
  Due to the dramatic changes caused by climate change, nearly every industry will be affected and thus this information should be valuable to a large amount of businesses.

6. What's the most popular?
  I think the idea of 'what is most popular' in regards to climate change is horrifically wrong, so I just hope that the idea itself is popular.

7. Cost/Money rankings
  I don't think the raw data of global temperature ratings will illuminate the cost of climate change, though the raw data can be used to extrapolate some results it isn't enough for actionable data for the majority of groups.
