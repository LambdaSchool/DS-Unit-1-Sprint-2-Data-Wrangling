## You

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

I could apply this to my data, but I am trying to focus more on the US. maybe towards the end I could see marriage rates and debt vs other countries as well.

2. Trend related to the news

this could apply based on presidential election platforms for free college

3. Who does that?

this can't apply, because my topic is too specific

4. Answering a question people care about

I dont think this can apply to my research because people don't really think about it that much


5. Valuable to businesses

THis may be valuable to states due to marriage license fees would make more money than student loans since those are privately owned


6. What's the most popular?

I don't know if this will be applicable to me


7. Cost/Money rankings

I can't think of something that would go with this


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

YOunger people aren't getting married due to not wanting to vs not being able to


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIViy7L_lo8
it uses data from the most searched terms of 2016 and created a video for each one


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

I dont't think there was a hypothesis, more of an informative topic


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

The new question could be "What were the least searched things?" or "What is the most bizzare things"


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

I would love to do a video like that eventually


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

I have my data from government websites and federal student loan sites
