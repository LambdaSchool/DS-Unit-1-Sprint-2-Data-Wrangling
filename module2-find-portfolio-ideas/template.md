# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about? 

Cooking. Depression, drug abuse, and mental health issues seem to be a staple in the culinary field. Is this caused by the nature of the 
industry or is the industry just a natural place for people with pre-existing conditions to end up?

What do you know about?


What decisions do you face?


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Are there any places that have higher/lower rates of mental health issues/drug abuse amongst kitchen workers?

2. Trend related to the news
People seem to ignore this issue until something dire happens (e.g. Anthony Bourdain suicide).

3. Who does that?
Are these conditions specific to Chefs? What about servers, front of house managers, etc...
What are the rates for these conditions in other fields?

4. Answering a question people care about
I think the nature of the subject is inherintly relatable and interesting to many people. 

5. Valuable to businesses
According to Forbes magazine mental health/substance abuse issues cost US businesses between $80-100 billion annually. (!!!) 

6. What's the most popular?
Not really sure how to answer this question!

7. Cost/Money rankings
Treatment costs, healthcare, cost to society (monetarily and ethically/morally), see question 5.


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

Could you do a new hypothesis for the same question?
As far as my topic, I hypothesis that people that have a predisposition for these traits
are initially drawn to the lifestyle of being a restaurant chef, but that the industry exacerbates these traits.

Could you do a new question for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic with the same "style"?

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
While I have been able to find multiple articles and documents regarding the fact that there is a problem, I have had a difficult time 
finding any raw data pertinent to the subject.

########################################################################


What do you care about? 
Where people get their food from over the last century. I'd like to explore the shift from agriculture/home cooking to 
fastfood/processed foods. 

What do you know about?


What decisions do you face?


Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Are people in certain regions more likely to eat certain foods?

2. Trend related to the news
How does this shift effect the health of the nation?

3. Who does that?
Are men and women effected differently? What about different races?

4. Answering a question people care about
Are we getting fat because of how our food is produced? (clickbait)

5. Valuable to businesses
HUGE industry

6. What's the most popular?
What is the most purchased food item per year from 1950-2019

7. Cost/Money rankings
Same as question 5.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Perhaps the eating habits of Americans hasn't changed so much as the way we produce and distribute our food has. Perhaps the change in
eating habits is a side effect of how food is made available and, more importantly, how the industry makes money.


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
A quick google search has brought up a lot of pertinent data sets with information on:
Diets
Public view on eating habits
Eating habits
Amounts of food production

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.

While I find the first topic more interesting and would love to work on it more, I feel that a lack of data would stop it before it
began. 
I think the second topic is a better choice in that there seems to be a plethora of data to work with both directly and to support interesting tidbits/juicy morsels to make the study enjoyable for the reader.
