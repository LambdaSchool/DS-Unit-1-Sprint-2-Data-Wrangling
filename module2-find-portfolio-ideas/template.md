# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
Books

What do you know about?
Sites like Goodreads and various other ways of finding new books to read. 

What decisions do you face?
The struggle of figuring which book, out of an impossibly large number of them, to read next. 

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
It might be interesting for users to be able to see what kinds of books are most popular in their area compared to other regions. 

2. Trend related to the news
I can't think of any obvious connections to the news, except for, perhaps, reader interest in the biographies of various political candidates or other well-known people. 

3. Who does that?
A lot of people buy books from bookstores, rate books on the book review site Goodreads, etc. 

4. Answering a question people care about
A lot of people feel overwhelmed with the expanse of information, so having a tool to deal with it will be helpful for them. 

5. Valuable to businesses
Bookstores, book recommendation sites like Goodreads, could all use better recommendation software. 

6. What's the most popular?
Ranking books in a particular category, or by geographical region, or by number of references from other sources could be interesting information. 

7. Cost/Money rankings
It might be interesting to see how much people are willing to pay for books, or which publishing companies or authors make the most money. 

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
That book readers are fairly uniform when two avid readers could have completely different book interests, and even people within a certain niche like crime novellas could have very specific tastes in that area.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
There are various databases dedicated to book ratings, and it might be possible to find information from booksellers like Amazon or Barnes and Nobles.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
It's important to find places that have high levels of innovation, and to try to predict what places will have high innovation based on (say) cultural diversity, educational institutions, size of city, government funding and institutions supporting development, etc. 

2. Trend related to the news
I'm not sure what trends further research will uncover, but there will undoubtedly be things that touch on current topics like effects of government regulation, immigration, etc. 

3. Who does that?
Innovators, scientists. 

4. Answering a question people care about
People want to know how to make more progress in innovation. 

5. Valuable to businesses
This research could be valuable to businesses for purposes of (re)location, or opening up a new branch, areas to focus for hiring, etc. 

6. What's the most popular?
It might be interesting to see if the most popular places for innovation actually are as good as people imagine. 

7. Cost/Money rankings
N/A 

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

I think this is something I would have to find, not something that I know ahead of time. I can't tell what guesses I would make in this area would be accurate or misconceptions. 

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Yes, there are a number of different possible hypotheses for the question of what makes a city great for business (and innovation). 

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
It would be interesting to look for inconsistencies in the theory that they have laid out about what makes cities business friendly by choosing a target variable (like rate of new business creation) and seeing in what ways the high-ranking cities do not meet the criteria that they laid out in the article. 

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
The infographic style definitely has diverse applications, and something like it could be used for the innovation topic. While the infographic style is easy to understand, the article could also have benefited from more charts and plots to find the intersections of various data attributes. 

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
Patent data would be a good place to start for US data. Nobel prize winners could be another place to look for data regarding scientific developments.
