Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

Do patients that live in lower income neighborhoods have worse post-surgical outcomes

2. Trend related to the news

Does the wealth gap affect the healthcare gap?  Are you likely to live longer if you have money?

3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about

Will you live longer if you drive a luxury car?

5. Valuable to businesses

Could raising minimum wage have an effect on longevity? 

6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings
