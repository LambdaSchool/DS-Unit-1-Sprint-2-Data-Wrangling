# Idea 1 for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about? - I care about NBA Basketball.


What do you know about? - I know a lot about the history of NBA Basketball.


What decisions do you face? - I'm faced with the decision of how to properly classify NBA basketball players based on characteristics of their play


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation - Yes, an analysis of NBA player charatersistics could be applied to basketball leagues at all levels all around the world


2. Trend related to the news - Yes, the NBA is practically a 12 month sport.  Having data to maximize an NBA team's potential efficiency is largely tied to their popularity and market value.


3. Who does that? - The NBA league, as well as its individual franchises, have entire statistics departments devoted to advanced analytics.  If such a dataset is chosen, my potential project will deal with a small subset of these advanced analytics - comparing modern vs traditional player position classifications.


4. Answering a question people care about - I would like to answer the question: "Is there a benefit to classifying player postions by a more modern criteria than the traditional system?"


5. Valuable to businesses - See #2


6. What's the most popular? - See #2.  The NBA is very popular.


7. Cost/Money rankings - See #2.
