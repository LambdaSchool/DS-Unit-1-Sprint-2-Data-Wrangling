# Ideas for data storytelling

What do you care about?

technology affect on the human mind(happiness, IQ)

What do you know about?

I know much about the history of technology, I also know about the design and function of technology. I know a bit about how the
brain works. 

What decisions do you face?

I have to decide where to get the best information. There is a lot of medical data available, but not always in a form or place
that is accessible. 

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation


2. Trend related to the news

Mental health is always in the news. IQ and happiness are both topics that one can see regularly. The media talk about the impact
of technology on human health.

3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about


5. Valuable to businesses

I think knowing what products people most trust to help them with mental health would be useful for a business seeking
to enter that market. Smarphone companies in particular might like to know if there is a trend where more people decide not to buy
smartphones and why. 

6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings

## Second Idea

Amanda Box

What do you care about?

I care about posture affect on health

What do you know about?

I know about back pain, I know how common it has become, I know of many health problems associated with it. I know there are all
sorts of products sold claiming to correct posture. There are also a lot of desks and chairs that claim to be solutions for modern
habits that cause problems with posture.

What decisions do you face?

I have to decide where to get the best information. There is a lot of medical data available, but not always in a form or place
that is accessible.

2. Trend related to the news

Back pain is a common topic because of how common it has become.

3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about

I think people really want to know what behaviors negatively impact their health. There are a lot of products and techniques
that claim to help with posture  and many of those may be products that are marketed well but don't work.

## Misconceptions

There is a misconception that chiropracty, which views posture as the center of health and wellness, is not real medicine. Although 
chiropractic techniques may or may not work, it is pretty clear to me that the alignment of the skeletal system and posture in general has enormous impacts on the rest of the body.


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

There was a story talking about how common conspiracy thinking is. I have always viewed conspiracy theories as very useful for
understanding how the human mind works. Although the more unusual theories are talked about and attributed to a strange minority,
it is actually a very common (and annoying) way of thinking. I think thinking in terms of conspiracy is part of human nature. I think it 
has to do with, funnily enough, being prone to story telling rather than using logic or research.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

The main question for this article seems to be whether or not scientists should try to stop conspiracy theories in order to save
the democratic process. I think that is a shallow question. Perhaps it is the fact that senators and presidents are paid so much,
the way pop culture is used for campaigns, and all the ways that governments manipulate things to shape the world according to their
desires that brings out the paranoia in people. 

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

I would ask if there were a way to test how conspiracy thinking changes if a government is not at war, and when senators and people in
the executive administration are not paid so much.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

I'm not a fan of this style, but it's a very easy style of presenting information.

## Data

I have tried searching on pubmed, and there is good information there though not so much excel or csv style information. I still need to
think about how to get data in the right format. 


# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.

I think i am most interested in posture, specifically in examing whether or not posture is as important as chiropractors claim.
