## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
  Which state is the safest/which states has had the largest increase in gun background checks, and is there a correlation?
  Where is each candidate most popular?
2. Trend related to the news
  The most recent shooting and where it took place.
  Which candidates are getting the most press coverage (for democrats, republicans, and independents).
3. Who does that?
  People who are planning on moving.
  People going to vote in the next presidential election.
4. Answering a question people care about
  Does the increase of background checks lead to a safer state?
  Who's most likely to be endorsed by each party?
5. Valuable to businesses
  Both are hot topics in America but the political one is more likely to be seen by broader audience.

6. What's the most popular?
  Like I said in the last question, the political one.

7. Cost/Money rankings
  Probably the housing markey in whichever state happens to be the safest.
  The democratic candidate that I think is going to make it to the final election.
## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
More guns = less safe or more guns = more safe.
The independents will not be the winner.
## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-republicans-and-democrats-are-doing-in-the-states-where-they-have-total-power/ 
"Who will make the second democratic debate?"
"Which democratic candidate was featured most in last week's news?"
Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
I predict that the places that increased the number of permits the most will be safer because if people knew other people owned guns, they wouldn't try to commit crimes out of the fear of dying.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Yes.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Yes.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
