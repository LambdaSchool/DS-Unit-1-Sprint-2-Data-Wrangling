# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?

**eSports, Physics(Astronomy, Solar/renewable energy)**

What do you know about?

**eSports & Astrophysics**

What decisions do you face?

**Should I continue to work with astronomy to compliment my degree, or should I do work outside of my degree with datasets closer to what is worked with in common data science jobs?**

**Would working with eSports for my portfolio make me look less professional to employers?**

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

    **Physics: what types of renewable energy can be generated in different geographical regeions**
    
    **eSports: does the type of game people play depend on their proximity to a large city?**
    
2. Trend related to the news

    **Physics: carbon footprint of different energy production/storage/transportation**

3. Who does that?

    **eSports: Age, gender, race of eSports competitors by the game they are playing**

4. Answering a question people care about

    **eSports: Does complaining negativley effect your tournament results**
    
    **Physics: should you invest in solar for your own home? cost analyasis panel/instilation cost vs availalbe sunlight space**

5. Valuable to businesses

    **eSports: do sponsorships effect sales in the target demagraphic, and how important is tournament placing compared to          online presence when it comes to sponsorship results**
    
    **Physics: is it worth upgrading to more energy efficient appliance? cost vs use, should you invest in solar?**

6. What's the most popular?

    **eSports: most popular eSport by tournament entrants, active players, tournament prize pool, twitch viewing, or advertisement revenue**

7. Cost/Money rankings

    **eSports: Does tournament infrustructure investment(consoles, tvs, game copies) coralate to the popularity of the game.**
    **Physics: 

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

   **Video games are a waste of time" not true, actually they can help you learn to: learn, be self critical, improve bad habits, thrive under pressure, understand the importance of practice, etc**

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

   **Renewable Energy: Really anywhere that offers free datasets has some on this topic**
   
   **Astronomy: I can get data from my research professor if he is willing to let me continue working on the project**
   
   **eSports: Hard to find, most datasets are behind paywalls or about games I don't care about**


# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
