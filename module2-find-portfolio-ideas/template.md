# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?

'Japan and Music'


What do you know about?

'Japanese language and Guitar'


What decisions do you face?

'I'm a student. How can I best show my skills to prospective employers?'

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

'Busiest train stations by time of day in Tokyo'

'Where do a majority of an artist's fans live?'


2. Trend related to the news

'How can Japan manage an increase in foot traffic at train stations during the 2020 Olympics?'

'How do negative press releases affect an artist's digital streams?'


3. Who does that?

'Are men or women more likely to travel via train during peak rush hours?'

'Concert ticket sales by gender'


4. Answering a question people care about

'What is the most-used kanji in Japanese names?'

'How often does John Mayer hit a D note in his music?'


5. Valuable to businesses

'How much money is lost each year due to train-hooping in Tokyo?'

'Does a person's social network help predict the types of music he/she is interested in?'


6. What's the most popular?

'The most popular maid cafe in Akihabara by year'

'The most popular song keys by genre'


7. Cost/Money rankings

'Which children's anime is most popular among senior adults?'

'What is the most popular ska song among country music fans?'


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

'Learning Japanese is hard. The train system is too confusing. The trains are always packed like sardines. Travel in Japan is too expensive. I'm screwed if I miss my train'

'All music nowadays sounds the same. Modern guitar players just rip off the old stuff'


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

"Saw on Twitter: a Lambda School student used data from a bike-sharing app/website and created a beautiful visualization that showed the bokes coming in and out of certain locations. I want to do something similar with Tokyo train data'


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

'Yes. If the data begins to dictate another storyline, then I should be able to pivot.'


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

'Yes. If the data begins to dictate another storyline, then I should be able to pivot.' 


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

'I don't see why not?'
