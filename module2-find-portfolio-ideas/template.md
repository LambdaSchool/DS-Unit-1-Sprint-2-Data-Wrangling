# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
nutrition, business, values, human relationships (family, friends, communities), relationship between tech, people and culture, economics, risk

What do you know about?
A little about a lot, mostly: nutrition, business, culture

What decisions do you face?
Topics of story I will tell include: most common ingredients (MCI) found in products of mega retail store chains, # of homeschooled (NOHK) kids and outcomes (per state), # of companies (NOC) that grew gradually vs those who followed a power law that dominate market / have attained extremely large value compared to other similar corporations.
## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Since the mega retail store chains are all around the US, ingredients won't vary by location.

2. Trend related to the news
It seems like there has been an increase of interest in nutrition and how it influences people's lives / health. There's magazines and articles on the keto & paleo diets, etc.

3. Who does that?
People interested in altering the way they eat would be interested in these kinds of stats. People who have heard of these diets but have not allocated the time to read more about them may find the stats insightful and lure them into learning more.

4. Answering a question people care about
Overall percentage of products that contain these common ingredients in catalog of common stores.

5. Valuable to businesses
Businesses or restaurants may benefit from this information. They may get a better idea of what not to include the the products and foods they sell or make. They may see a need for better options and work to provide them to those who are already interested or are becoming interested in nutrition.

6. What's the most popular?
There's a good chance there will be one ingredient that stands out, but I'm not sure if this is important. What's important is the aggregate.

7. Cost/Money rankings
Does ingredients in products affect price range? This might be a good idea to look into. If a set of products have say, 7 of the most common ingredients and another set of products have 2, will their price averages vary significantly?

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Nutrition is usually disregarded when it directly affects people's health (most visibly in the long-run). Elders feel better 
depending on their lifestyle years behind. People who haven't experienced critical conditions (the younger ones) don't think or are not aware of how things could be different, for the better. 

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
Online store catalogs.


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
NOHK could be appropiately analyzed with physical variations in mind. Possible variables that enable variations in rankings for NOHK may be income, time available (to give to children) effort/responsibility (curriculum), educational options readily available (quality-of-schools dependent), personal (parents) values/views. 

2. Trend related to the news
With the student loan debt crisis and the general public's negative impression of schools in the US, giving education a lot of attention, information on other options may prove helpful. Outcomes of homeschooled children 10 years from their "graduating" moment could be interesting to look into as well.

3. Who does that?
n/a

4. Answering a question people care about
What is the best option for children.

5. Valuable to businesses
A new start up may try to find a way to alleviate some of the barriers that impede parents from homeschooling their kids. Currently, it seems like it is limited to those who have the time and money. 

6. What's the most popular?
Is there a specific pattern as to how parents or hired educators teach homeschooled kids?

7. Cost/Money rankings
An average cost (both money and time) per state might be insightful to those interested or are considering that option more.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
A common misconception that I've heard is that people don't think homeschooling is normal and healthy for children. People think that a child is socially isolated from their peers and may grow to be socially inept. This may be true for children that are homeschooled by incompetent parents/hired-educators that don't understand the importance of socializing. However, the probability that this happens is low, that is assuming, that the educators know what they're are doing since they opted out from traditional education.
