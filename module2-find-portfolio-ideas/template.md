# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about? I care about animals (birds specifically). I'm also interested in demographic trends


What do you know about? I know a fair bit about birds, I also know some history, and more esoteric things


What decisions do you face? I will soon be facing a decision of where i want to live. 


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation - migratory patterns of birds


2. Trend related to the news


3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about - specific to birdwatchers, but they can find out which birds are near them at different 
                                            times in the year


5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you? Mezmerizing Migration Map was a very inspiring piece


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic? I'd like to approach this topic with the question of which kinds of birds migrate/how far they go. Aside from categorical variables like 'bird of prey', 'songbird', 'waterfowl'; I can also look at lifespan, mass, and wingspan to see how it relates to migration patterns


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic? I found data from the University of Michigans Quaardvark website. I also found data
                                                  from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology


# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
