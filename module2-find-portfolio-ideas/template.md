# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
-Public transportation efficiency and delays

What do you know about?
-I know that Toronto was voted as the #1 public transit subway in North America, but the service certainly feels less than ideal as an everyday passenger. 

What decisions do you face?
-The subway data is broken up by separate monthly files. It might be easy but tedious to merge 12-18 files to cover at least 1.5 years of data

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
-Yes: you can filter by station

2. Trend related to the news
-Yes: you can probably compare trends with important dates of changes to service e.g. transition to Presto

3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about
-Which stations face the most delays? What kinds of delays occur most at each station? How long is the average delay? What is the variance?

5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
-That the TTC's service standards are quite poor. But with this data we can put things into perspective.
-That the reason for delays is for reasons under the TTC's control (equipment) vs passengers being unruly 

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
-This is a really good start to exploring the data: http://www.mapto.ca/maps/ttcdelays
-But it only touches the surface of questions I want answered. Further more I have two new years worth of data to add.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
-Yes. We hypothesize which days, stations are most likely to face delays based on anedoctal reports. 

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
-Yes. The data is quite fine-grained, we can do many cross-tabulations such as delay by day of the week and station. 

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
-Yes, but with a better narrative to discuss the data 

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
-It's available on the City of Toront's open data website: https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/transportation/#917dd033-1fe5-4ba8-04ca-f683eec89761

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
