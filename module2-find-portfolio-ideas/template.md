# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
I'm a big hardware and hardware cooling buff. (Also an AMD fanboy), I love cars, mostly Older Jeeps And Hondas,
I like classic movies a lot too, and music, classic rock mostly.
What do you know about?
A lot of specifications, I know just about everything there is to know about classic Jeeps.

What decisions do you face?
I have to decide which interest I want to use, I have to decide very carefully on my datasets, and find out how I can get the most data,
With multiple datasets which will be a decision on what to use in and of itself.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 
Boolean = True
1. Geographic Variation
I could figure out sales for my topic for the given year,
I could compare the most popular states for each manufacturer
Same thing for old Jeeps
2. Trend related to the news
Well AMD did just drop Ryzen Gen 3, which is sortof a big deal. I could see trends pertaining to data surrounding Ryzen
Jeep is always in the news, so that's exciting.
3. Who does that?
The demographic is primarily male aged 15-60, globally, but applies to anyone with an interest in technology.
Jeep consumers
4. Answering a question people care about
Yes definitely x2
a lot of people 
5. Valuable to businesses
This could be very valuable to a business.
For example AMD, or a business producing aftermarket coolers, or motherboards, they might need to know
which brand is more popular, so they know who to produce for.
6. What's the most popular?
Probably the amount of cards sold

7. Cost/Money rankings
Yes it will most definitely  
Yes it will apply.
## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Some people think that Intel outsells AMD to a large margin,
Whereas since AMD is more budget concious, a lot of people do go with AMD.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
The data scientists that output sales period, and work on the news.
