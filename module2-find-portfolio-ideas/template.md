# Ideas for data storytelling

## You


1st topic idea:
environment/conservation. I have some knowledge of cons bio and would love to look at city by city comparisons somehow, such as which cities will be underwater in one hundred years. 

2nd topic idea:
taking a look at car accidents and their causes. may be overdone. maybe get an attention-grabbing headline about how you're xy% more likely to get in a car accident if you're on your phone. could be a little morbid. misconception could be that people think looking at their phone or having a drink or two then driving is not a big deal.

3rd topic idea:
something about food and personality, very buzzfeed. 'if you like a certain food a lot it correlates with neuroticism' or other traits. misconception could be if i find a result that is the antithesis of that which people associate that food.

4th topic idea:
Friends tv show. what do the most highly rated episodes of Friends tell us about the American public at the time who watched them?

It's difficult to decide on a topic at this point. Maybe leaning towards Friends, though.
