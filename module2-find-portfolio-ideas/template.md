# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
- Cost of Living
- Effects of diet on health


What do you know about?
- audio engineering


What decisions do you face?
- where to move / where to look for work


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
    - How does the cost of living vary by region or state? How does the difference between rural and urban costs of living change by state?
    - How does the average diet profile (total calories, percent carbs, etc.) vary by state?
    - What regions have the loudest concerts?
    - what city has the best savings profile (median income after taxes minus living expenses)?
    - How uneven geographically is inflation over time?


2. Trend related to the news
    - Are incomes increasing with low unemployment?
    - How volatile are grain prices recently with the trade disputes?


3. Who does that?
    - How does average diets differ between men and women?
    - Do audio engineers age out because of decreased hearing?


4. Answering a question people care about
    - Does long-term headphone use adversely affect hearing?
    - Does adopting a minimalist lifestyle have the expected positive effect on cost of living?


5. Valuable to businesses
    - Where are people moving to, where are they moving from?
    - Are people moving more or less than previous decades?


6. What's the most popular?
    - How long do people stick with different changes to their diet?


7. Cost/Money rankings
    - What are the cost differences between vegan, omnivore, and carnivore diets?


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?


# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
