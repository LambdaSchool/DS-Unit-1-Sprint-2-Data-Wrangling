# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?

In general: Making a positive impact on the world. Family, friends, etc.
Specific: Politics (mostly substantive issues but also its procedural and tactical aspects), philosophy, history, economics, video games, anime/manga, the NBA.

What do you know about?

The above, and also a lot of other random knowledge I've picked up through the years (e.g. chess, dungeons and dragons, etc).

What decisions do you face?

What to do as a career; what philosophical/political topics I want to write about (and how); how to interact with my family and friends; how to best take care of my cats; what to do with my free time.

## Seven templates (1 - Politics)

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

How a policy affects different regions differently--e.g. the ratio between minimum wage and unemployment across different regions (though that's a heavily-studied topic).

2. Trend related to the news

Lots of options here--possibly something involving refugees, such as the number of refugees in a particular city and their impact (or lack thereof) on things such as economic productivity or crime rate.

3. Who does that?

Demographics pulled from polling data--either voting data or issue polling data.

4. Answering a question people care about

"Why did Trump win?" is perhaps beyond my current skill level, but I could perhaps try my hand at some 2020 predictions based on data from previous election years.

5. Valuable to businesses

Is there a way to collect data on the visible political activity of business? Because I could see what affect various types of political activity has on a business's profitability. Perhaps separate it out by type of political activity--donations to politicians, publicly supporting/opposing certain policies, etc.

6. What's the most popular?

Most judgments on the popularity of policies are done with polling data--maybe it would be interesting to explore other ways to measure this, such as the most popular activist causes.

7. Cost/Money rankings

I guess I could compare the cost of various proposals or government initiatives in a certain area.

## Misconceptions (1 - Politics)

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

Loads! What immediately comes to mind is how ahistorical so much political analysis is. Politics--especially American politics--tends to stay the same for a while, then undergo a rapid, wrenching change before hitting a new "status quo." And yet a lot of political data analysis tends to paper over these differences and just lump data from all time periods together.

## Examples (1 - Politics)

What data storytelling example inspires you?

I'm not sure I'd necessarily say "inspires," but the book *Racial Realignment* by Eric Schickler does a very good job combining data analysis with historical research to argue a persuasive yet contrarian point--black voters began moving to the Democratic Party not in the 1960s, as is traditionally assumed, but in the mid-1930s.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

Potentially yes, but I find Schickler's hypothesis convincing so I don't think I could do it well.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

Potentially. Shickler focuses mainly on the 30s and 40s, so I could expand the analysis to the 50s and 60s, and examine just how the black vote changed in those decades both nationally and at the state level. Alternately, I could conduct a similar analysis for different demographic groups, such as latinx voters or "white working class" voters.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

I'm not entirely sure what "style" means here; Shickler's method of combining data and historical analysis could be applied to just about any topic that's amenable to both those types of analyses.

## Data (1 - Politics)

Where could you search for data about your topic?

Lots of websites gather up polling data; I'm not sure where to find old election and demographic data for a Shickler-type analysis, but I could follow his lead on that one.

## Seven templates (2 - Anime/Manga)

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

The popularity of anime/manga across states or countries.

2. Trend related to the news

The last related news item I can recall was the arson attack on Kyoto Animation's headquarters a few months ago, and no data analysis-related thing comes to mind offhand.

3. Who does that?

Demographic breakdown of some sort of anime/manga consumption.

4. Answering a question people care about

"What's with the tentacles?" I could find some way to analyze the number of tentacle-related anime/manga products year by year.

5. Valuable to businesses

What kinds of anime/manga are popular now versus a decade ago? What might this indicate regarding changing consumer taste?

6. What's the most popular?

Hmm...maybe I could see what the most popular *episode* is of a bunch of different shows, and see if I can find any trends in that?

7. Cost/Money rankings

New anime and manga tend to sell for a set price, but perhaps I could see what the most expensive, e.g., 90s-era anime DVDs are these days.

## Misconceptions (2 - Anime/Manga)

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

I've believed for a while that anime and manga have better female representation than a lot of people might assume, especially relative to Western media. So I could pursue that comparison. Another comparison would be percent of anime/manga with a non-Japanese protagonist, compared to percent of American TV with a non-American protagonist.

## Examples (2 - Anime/Manga)

What data storytelling example inspires you?

To be honest, I don't really have one related to this topic! There isn't much data storytelling in the anime/manga field, at least not in English. For an unrelated data storytelling thing that inspires me, pretty much everything Jon Bois has ever done, but especially his two-part video on athletes named Bob: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvh6NLqKRfs&t= (part 1)

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

In the video, Bois doesn't so much make a hypothesis as just tell a bunch of interesting stories about athletes named "Bob," aided by data. I could do a similar thing with e.g. every anime character who has a certain name.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

Instead of name, I could pick some other inconsequential characteristic to focus on--hair color, perhaps? Anime is known for having weird hair colors.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

What I liked the most about Bois's video was how he took things that seemingly don't matter--a "Bob" who lost a few boxing matches then disappeared--and made them fascinating, or took things that normally don't matter to non-fans--Bob Gibson's ridiculous pitching season and Bob Beamon's word-record long jump--and made them incredibly compelling, partly using data and partly by focusing on the human aspect. I could do something similar with a seemingly inconsequential anime/manga, or a consequential one that doesn't matter to non-fans, and tell its story in a way that appeals even to people who don't know about or don't like Japanese media.

## Data (2 - Anime/Manga)

Where could you search for data about your topic?

I know there are websites that collect data about anime/manga, and others like myanimelist that let users input which anime they like and keep that data. Some of the topics I've proposed, though, might take a lot more work--e.g. I'm not sure if there's collated data regarding characters' hair colors anywhere.

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.

# Compare and Contrast

Both topics contain ideas that I can see myself reasonably completing and also being interested in. Politics, being by far the more popular topic for data analysis, contains a lot more datasets I could use; however, that also means it's harder to find an original topic to pursue, while there's tons of opportunities to do anime/manga data analysis that nobody else has done before.

Currently, I'm kind of leaning toward choosing an obscure anime or manga that I personally like and "tell its story" with the aid of data, Jon Bois-style. But I don't have any real idea how to do that yet--I'd have to think about it for a while. On the other hand, it would be relatively straightforward to, say, gather data on which activist organizations have been most popular since 2016 and telling a story about that. So I'm torn, but I do think the former idea is more original.
