# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
- [2] Health, nutrition, veganism, ethics(mostly Health / Nutrition for this assignments purposes)
- Climate Change
- Custom Desktop computers
- Game A.I. (Something I want to learn more about)
- Content Creation (Recordings / Streams, etc.)
- [1] DataScience implementation in the Legal Cannabis industry(like collecting and exploring the 'Big Data' side)

What do you know about?
- Veganism / Ethics and Nutrition.
- Some video production, Microphone audio(a little bit), streaming/recording/best practices, etc.
- Custom Desktop Computers

What decisions do you face?
- Which places would I want to move relocate to? Based off of weather, ease of access to work / job oppertunities, etc.

### My Idea(question) and Hypothesis
1. Does increased Cannabis use show any correlation with increased other substance abuse in teens and young adults as they age?
    - __Hypothesis__: I propose that increased cannabis use in teens leads to "trying" other drugs at an early age, but if started at a later age, decreases likelyhood of "trying" other more harmful drugs.
2. Does a whole food plant-based diet(WFPB) show improvements in health over the Standard American Diet(S.A.D)? 
    - __Hypothesis__: I propose that a WFPB diet is better suited for humans as it provides better nutrition and better health outcomes / the reversing of the top 15 leading causes of death in humans.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics?

_([1] is idea / topic #1, same thing goes for [2] = #2)_
1. Geographic Variation
    - [1] Yes, using this I could learn that certain areas have a higher chance of their populous trying other drugs if they consume cannabis, vs areas that are less "experimentally drug oriented".
    - [2] Yes very much so, people cover this planet _like_ a plague. We ARE the DATA!! ðŸ¤£ We can see if people from ___ are at risk for ___ based of of their diet, activity level / other, and compare them to one another, seeing where is the healthiest etc.

2. Trend related to the news
    - [1] Could apply, open conversation promotes understanding and acceptance, Could make the topic boom(_in popularity_)
    - [2] Yes, if the correct information got to the public we could see an uptick trend of new products, better overall countrywide health, etc.

3. Who does that?
    - [1] Yes this can be applied, based on customers purchase history you can see and compare _who_(demographic(not private information)), what(item), and when(time scale).
    - [2] Yes, with a proper dataset we would be able to see who(demographic), and region. As just about everyone: eats(in some form), drinks(again, in some form), and can move around(3rd time, again in some form). Making it somewhat easy to target this industry for capital growth.

4. Secret data answering a question people care about
    - [1] Not exactly sure.
    - [2] Yes. We are learning about new things in health, nutrition, etc. all the time! This makes the health industry scrounge for the next 'quick buck' as they usually dont want whats best for the consumer but what ever will make them the most money the quickist(its the point of their business, to make the company money). Hidden or secret data could open up a new subset-_like_ market of the original.

5. Valuable to businesses
    - [1] Yes, they could, if they see who is doing other forms of drugs, not sure it would be the best thing though, would allow legal cannabis companies to get a better feel for the type of demographic that they could sell their products to, to take the place of the harder drugs they may be already taking. Maybe someone will get some help with an addiction.
    - [2] Yes. If you know what _people_ are eating and how they are dieing you can _swoop_ into the niche market before others, and before it gets over crowded(already happening today)

6. What's the most popular?
    - [1] Yes, most likley teens trying cannabis and ending up using hard drugs later on would be the most popular, as adults who can obtain their medicine / recreational _fun_ time wouldnt need to go to harder drugs as they can more easily "get their fix".
    - [2] yes. What is the most or least popular 'health food' that company 'a' sells.

7. Cost/Money rankings
    - [1] probably not?
    - [2] Yes, as companies who produce wfpb options start themselves up, they will have other competition to try and beat out the others in: price, nutritional value, and the one that supersedes the other will profit largely. 
    
(_I hope this layout format isnt too difficult to understand when it comes to my splintered responces_)

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
- [1] The dangers of consuming cannabis as is, simply, there are not many, THC sickness, and a dependency depending on consumption habits, and other things like dry mouth, redish eyes, and well munchies. Besides the actual negatives to consuming cannabis, most of the 'negatives' out there are on the topic of it being a 'gateway' drug. Seemingly if the mass majority of people have access to cannabis they are less likley to try other drugs. So the worst it will get(for those who dont actually try other drugs) are the symptoms i've stated above.(note: someone somewhere will always be doing hard drugs, there will always be an illegal market for it. Simply open cannabis to adults and this problem is deminished(already happening around the US/other), remember Prohibition? Me neither(Cause... none of us were born yet :D ).)
- [2] that 'good health' is built in the gym or anywhere thats not your kitchen. The opposite is true, where do you get abs? The kitchen. Essentually you can't be healthy with a bad diet, your body knows what it needs, instead most fill it with junk. 

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
- I don't know of any that have inspired me as of yet.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
- [1] "cannabis consumption does not directly lead to trying 'hard drugs'."
- [2] "A wfpb diet shows immediate changes within a short time span of about a week in a subjects health and overall diesease risk."

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
- [1] "Is cannabis consumption causal in the ability to retain information, compared to non consumers/subjects that are 'sober' for <x amount of time>?"
- [2] "What role does our variety of diet play in our disease risk?" 

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
- [1] cigarette smoke vs cannabis smoke, long term/short term effects on the lungs
- [2] fruits vs candy

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
- [1] data.world perhaps
- [2] open medical journal websites that share their studies datasets maybe

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.

- I personally think the Cannabis topic in some form is what I an leaning towards, depending on a few factors, like datasets and pay walls, etc.
