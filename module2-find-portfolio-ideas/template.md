# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
I care about video games mostly, and data science.

What do you know about?
Again,  video games, coding(a little), music.

What decisions do you face?
I'm pretty concerned about my future work options, and current ones. 

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
You could apply geographic info, assuming it was collected.

2. Trend related to the news
Video games, shootings, the news thinks they influence eachother

3. Who does that?
Most everyone uses that information, mostly to determine if they think games are safe, or if certain content should be allowed.

4. Answering a question people care about
Do games actually have an effect on the rate of violent crimes?

5. Valuable to businesses
If they don't, any business that makes video games would find that valuable. Even if they do, the companies would want that info to tailor future releases.

6. What's the most popular?
I suppose we could look and see if shooters are even the most popular genre

7. Cost/Money rankings
We could further explore if companies releasing these games see big hits in sales after violent crimes.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
I really liked the example on priceonomics about home network security from Avast.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
I don't think so, their goal was mostly survey.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
What kind of device is most likely to present a security threat to your home network?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Definitely, there are lots of interesting global questions to ask.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
I'm currently looking places like Kaggle and Data.gov


# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
