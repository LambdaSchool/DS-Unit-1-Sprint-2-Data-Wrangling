## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics?  
a.) Movie box office revenue by genre over time  
-It's possible that there's some kind of geographic variation in the popularity of various genres of movies.  
-Knowing trends in what the movie-going public is looking for would be valuable to studios and distributors.  
-You could list the most popular genres.  
-You could rank genres by production expenses.  
  
b.) How high of an income do you need to be in the top 1% in each state    
-This topic focuses on a geographic variation.  
-Income inequality is also a topic that is often discussed in the news.    
-You could investigate demographic data of the top 1% of income earners.    
-You could rank the income required to be at this level in each state.    
  
1. Geographic Variation


2. Trend related to the news


3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about


5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?  
a.) It would take a lot of investigation to see if this theory is supported by evidence, but it could be the case that genres see a sort of cyclic boom and bust over time. This could be due to the fact that studios look at box office sucesses of the previous few years and draw the wrong lessons by attributing it to genre instead of the actual underlying factors that lead to popularity. This leads to a few box office disasters in a particular genre, after which the studios again learn the wrong lesson and assume the the genre has merely run its course and is no longer popular.  
b.) For this topic I'd have to look at the data more before having an idea of what misconceptions people may have. Perhaps people underestimate the amount of income it takes to be in the top 1% in various states.


## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?  

"The Atlas of Redistricting" on FiveThirtyEight.  

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?  
a.) Sure. For example, the popularity of genres might be some kind of reflection of the historical moment or of widespread cultural anxieties. At first blush this hypothesis seems difficult to quantify, though.   
b.) You could focus more on the geographic distribution of higher incomes. However, again I'm not clear on whether or not that would yield interesting results.  
  
Could you do a new question, for the same topic?  
a.) You could investigate box office pull over time as it relates to a variety of different factors: directors, actors, budget, etc...  
b.) You could investigate the disparity between the top X% of incomes versus the bottom X% of incomes as it varies over geographical area, for instance.  
  
Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?  
a.) There are plenty of things that you could investigate the popularity/profitability of over time. Maybe different forms of entertainment.  
b.) There are also plenty of economic factors that would be interesting to invesitgate the geographic distribution of. Maybe the percentage of people who own stock by state, for example.    
  
## Data
  
Where could you search for data about your topic?  
a.) IMBD has publicly available data.  
b.) I could look at census data or other forms of data provided by the US government.
