# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
Baseball, availability of healthy and nutritious food throughout the country.

What do you know about?
The existence of food deserts in the US - geographical areas that lack sufficient supply of fresh vegetables, fruits, and healthful, affordable whole foods. A desire to question the value of large sports contracts in baseball and basketball.

What decisions do you face?
Whether there is sufficient enough data to perform analysis on the topic of food deserts, and whether this topic is something that has been analyzed too much previously by others.
For the sports contracts - what statistics and measures I can use to successfully determine if the value of large contracts in baseball are truly worth it. And if certain players (e.g. - highly paid but under performing, or older players who are past their prime who received their payday in the form of a large, long term contract) offset that value.

## Seven templates (Baseball contracts)

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Teams who are located in larger cities have bigger markets for fanbases and potential revenue, so those teams tend to have bigger total salary caps for their players.

2. Trend related to the news
This past offseason in the MLB, there was an issue of several players who perform at an above-average level who were unable to sign contracts with teams because the players felt that they deserved more money, whereas the owners did not agree. As a result, a few of these players went months into the season without signing a contract.

3. Who does that?
An analysis on the value of players and large contracts in baseball could be useful to players, agents, team owners, as well as fans who wonder if highly paid players on their favorite team are overpaid.

4. Answering a question people care about
Fans who have stronger feelings about their favorite baseball team often have questions and criticize the front office of the team regarding decisions about contracts and the value of said contracts.

5. Valuable to businesses
If teams and their front offices read my article, they could take that into account when it comes to offering contract renewals for their players or for offering contracts when trying to sign free agents. 

6. What's the most popular?
A further analysis could be performed on whether popular players are more worth their highly paid contracts due to the marketability of said player. 

7. Cost/Money rankings
Do the teams who have higher payrolls bring in more revenue and more profit?

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
The players who are more highly paid should perform better. The teams who have higher payrolls should be more successful.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Could possibly do a new hypothesis regarding whether a team's location and their market size affects their performance and success.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
The new question could potentially be - do players who get bigger contracts bring more revenue to the team due to marketability or other factors?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
It is possible to do the same "style" on different subjects such as movie stars and their salaries and the amount of revenue/success their films bring in, as well as other sports such as basketball.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
baseball-reference for statistics regarding player performance and value. Project538 for team performance/success.  Other resources for team revenue and profit.


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Rural areas tend to have higher populations of people affected by food deserts. Urban areas are also affected, but the definition changes to "an area with no ready access to a store with fresh and nutritious food options within one mile," where as in rural areas, it is defined as 10 miles or more from the nearest market.‚Äù

2. Trend related to the news
It is a popular topic on the news with topics varying from how it affects people who live in food deserts, as well as what efforts organizations are making in order to help those affected.

3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about
Food deserts have great effects on health and nutrition. People living in those areas suffer difficulties and have a higher difficulty of eating a healthy diet, which leads to worse health conditions.

5. Valuable to businesses
This data/analysis could be helpful to business who's priorities focus around making sure a larger portion of the population have an opportunity for a healthy and nutrious diet.

6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings
Grocery stores and food markets offer consumers more nutritious and healthy food at lower costs than what a convenience store could offer.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
That everyone has the option to eat healthy nutritious meals.

## Examples

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
No.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Does the lack of readily available food markets and groceries lead to more health problems, such as diabetes?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
No.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
News websites, American nutrition sites, University websites who have posted studies and data regarding the subject.
