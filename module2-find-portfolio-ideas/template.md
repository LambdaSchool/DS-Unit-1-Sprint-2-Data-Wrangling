## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Can analyze demographic variances of how many people have a neurodegen disease in which areas of the US

2. Trend related to the news
Nothing big in the news, but neurodegenerative diseases are always a worry and constantly increasing

3. Who does that?
It is mainly seniors who have the neurodegenerative diseases, but can see if increase in early-onset diseases

4. Answering a question people care about
What is the likelihood of neurodegen diseases in your area, if your area has a high prevelance

5. Valuable to businesses
Target ads for neurodegen treatments in areas of higher prevelance

6. What's the most popular?
Alzheimers Disease is the most common in the US

7. Cost/Money rankings
N/A

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Many people think neurodegen diseases comes from certain items that pop up in news articles whenever ONE paper shows there may be correlation.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
Unrelated, but the life expectancy in the alps data story example shown in class was great to see.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Lower prevelance of neurodegen diseases in the alps may be a part of the increased life expectancy

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
^^

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
Yes, the heat map of the US was great to use

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
This has been an issue, data.gov did not have much and am having trouble finding good datasets

Not really
