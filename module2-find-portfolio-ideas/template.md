Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

'How do negative press releases affect an artist's digital streams?'


3. Who does that?

'Are men or women more likely to travel via train during peak rush hours?'

'Concert ticket sales by gender'


4. Answering a question people care about

'What is the most-used kanji in Japanese names?'

'How often does John Mayer hit a D note in his music?'


5. Valuable to businesses

'How much money is lost each year due to train-hooping in Tokyo?'

'Does a person's social network help predict the types of music he/she is interested in?'


6. What's the most popular?

'The most popular maid cafe in Akihabara by year'

'The most popular song keys by genre'


7. Cost/Money rankings

'Which children's anime is most popular among senior adults?'

'What is the most popular ska song among country music fans?'
