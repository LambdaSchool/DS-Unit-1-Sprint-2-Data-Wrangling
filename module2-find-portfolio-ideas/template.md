## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

Crypto mining is bad for the environment: There can be algorithums that are energy consumptoin frendly. 

Linux is hard to use: There has been study that when you introduce linux vs windows to a brand new user, linux is more intuitive.

Addiction is a physical dependancy to a drug: Recent studys show that the mental/emotinal/lifestly /happyness are much stronger indicators to weather people were to get addicted to a drug or not.

Video game piracy increase sales, and are assosiated to less review loss.
