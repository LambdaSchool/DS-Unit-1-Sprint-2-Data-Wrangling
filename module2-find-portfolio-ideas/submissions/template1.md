What data storytelling example inspires you? - Back when I was younger, I read about a man in a Game Informer Magazine who was teaching a computer to play NES games. He wrote an artice and shared his findings with the magazine.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question? - Perhaps later on in our DS class, I can make a machine that can also play games

Could you do a new question, for the same topic? - Who plays a game better: A human, or a machine learning AI?

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"? -
