# Ideas for data storytelling

## Topic

What is the relationship between autism spectrum diagnoses and government programs for austism spectrum disorders? Depending on the data available I would like to look at this country-by-country. If the data isn't available then I may just look at the US state-by-state.


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation 
This clearly applies. Looking at variation in diagnosis rates across both time and region.


2. Trend related to the news
Autism has been in the news with regard to the increase in the austism spectrum diagnoses and vaccinations even given the many studies that have not shown correlation between mmr vaccines and autism. I would like examine other factors that may be contributing to that increase.

3. Who does that?
N/A

4. Answering a question people care about
N/A

5. Valuable to businesses
N/A

6. What's the most popular?
N/A

7. Cost/Money rankings
N/A

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic? 
Quite a few. Vaccines cause autism is the most obvious. Autism spectrum used to be split between austism and Aspergers Syndrom before the DSM was updated (I believe in 2013?). At that time the decision was made to bring Aspergers under the Autism diagnosis in recognition of autism as a spectrum disorger. I've actually been curious to see if that may impact diagnosis incidence longterm since diagnosticians and parents may be more hesitant to apply the austism label rather than the Aspergers label.


## Examples

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic? government sites, World Health Organization, UN data
