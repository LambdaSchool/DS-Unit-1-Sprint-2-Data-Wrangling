# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
> I am considering looking at some data related to the relative of wealth of U.S. senators.

What do you know about?
> I am a U.S. citizen familiar with the basic structure of the government.

What decisions do you face?
> I have to decide which candidate or party to vote for and which state to live in.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
> Yes, state-by-state variation is a natural component of this topic.

2. Trend related to the news
> Yes, wealth and politics are both current topics.

3. Who does that?
> No, it's not really a usage or population-wide question, except insofar as it might imply something about voter behavior.

4. Answering a question people care about
> No, because the relevant data are not secret, although they may not be common knowledge.

5. Valuable to businesses
> No.

6. What's the most popular?
> No. Elected candidates may be in some sense "the most popular", but I will not be comparing them to also-ran candidates.

7. Cost/Money rankings
> Yes, this topic is very much about monetary rankings.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
> It's common knowledge that senators are wealthier than representatives. It's probably also fairly common knowledge that they receive a respectable salary from the U.S. government ($174,000 annually for most, $193,400 for the Senate President pro tempore, as well as majority and minority leaders).

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
> https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2015/01/one-member-of-congress-18-american-households-lawmakers-personal-finances-far-from-average/

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question? Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
> I could investigate how these personal finances numbers look by state, by party, or by time in office.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
> The style of this piece is verbally dense, with only a handful of tables a single graph. I'd prefer to do something with a more visual style, taking advantage of the tools we have for that.

## Data
