# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
  - I'm curious about the generation of energy at a global scale. Most-often this is a conversation had at a hyper-politicized level. This tends to make the content largely underwhelming. 

What do you know about?
  - I don't know much about the energy space, but I'm interested. This seems like a good way to explore a topic.
  - I read a good portion of the book 'Energy and Civilization A History', I suppose that's a start.

What decisions do you face?
  - Whether or not to participate in conversations on the topic...? I'm not exactly a mover in this space. Maybe I don't fully understand the question.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
  - How is power generated around the world?
  - The composition of power generation within and between countries?
  - What is the scale of these various methods?

2. Trend related to the news
  - There is a very popular and compelling push toward both green energy and electrification of the vehicle fleet.
  - For purposes of this project I need to narrow the scope, so I'll focus on how power is generated.

3. Who does that?
  - This could be answered by country, but also by overlaying demographic info within countries.

4. Answering a question people care about
  - Everyone wants green energy, is that feasible?

5. Valuable to businesses
  - Certainly to those in the industry, outside the industry it's more of a utility cost that's largely unavoidable (i.e. not a variable businesses can do much about.

6. What's the most popular?
  - Could totally make a horse-race animation with some of this info in some areas... At a glance, the US has the best data.

7. Cost/Money rankings
  - Could definitely rank the methods of power generation by cost per unit of energy.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
  - I think there are a lot of misconceptions. I'm sure I'm guilty of having a number of them myself. I see this as a way to empirically explore an area that interests me.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-and-changing-energy-sources#

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
  - I'm not sure I'd be so bold as to offer a new hypothesis, but an exploration of the raw data would certainly be interesting.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
  - Possibly!

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
  - Definitely, Our World in Data uses the same style for a wide range of topics.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
  - There is a fairly rich publicly available data set from the US.
  - There is a compiled dataset for the rest of the world, but data ex-US seems less robust at a glance.

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
