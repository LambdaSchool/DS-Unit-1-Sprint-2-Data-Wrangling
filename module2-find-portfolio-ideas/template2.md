# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?Star Wars the Old Republic(SWTOR) is probably my favorite game


What do you know about?I know a good bit about SWTOR, there's also an api available online, though it will take some exploration to figure out exactly what stories can be told with it.


What decisions do you face?In the context of SWTOR, which guild to join, things to purchase on the trade network.


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
There's a European server, to server specific information could be available


2. Trend related to the news
I don't think this game has trended for a while, but Star Wars has almost never been out of the news for all that long since its inception.

3. Who does that?
Lots of people play SWTOR, it's a massively multiplayer game, so the whole playerbase could be interested really.

4. Answering a question people care about
What things can you buy from the GTN, then have a good chance of selling again for a profit later.

5. Valuable to businesses
This story probably wouldn't be too valuable for businesses, though the game developers may be interested, to help make sure their game's economy doesn't crash heh.

6. What's the most popular?
Not sure

7. Cost/Money rankings
Some things can be bought for money and sold for credits, a dollar value for credits could be figured out.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Probably that things bought with real money are the only way to actually profit.

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
The simpsons one listed in the training kit.

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
He answered quite a few questions, but a lot of them could actually be asked about things in SWTOR.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Which items should you never buy unless you actually need them.

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
I'm unsure on this one.

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
SWTOR has a data api, though it's incomplete.

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
