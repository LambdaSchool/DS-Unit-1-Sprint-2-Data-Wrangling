# # ASSIGNMENT
# 
# ### 1) Replicate the lesson code. I recommend that you [do not copy-paste](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ubOw9B3Hfip27hF2ZFnW3a3z9xAgrUDRReOEo-FHCVs/edit).
# 
# Get caught up to where we got our example in class and then try and take things further. How close to "pixel perfect" can you make the lecture graph?
# 
# Once you have something that you're proud of, share your graph in the cohort channel and move on to the second exercise.
# 
# ### 2) Reproduce another example from [FiveThityEight's shared data repository](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/).
# 
# **WARNING**: There are a lot of very custom graphs and tables at the above link. I **highly** recommend not trying to reproduce any that look like a table of values or something really different from the graph types that we are already familiar with. Search through the posts until you find a graph type that you are more or less familiar with: histogram, bar chart, stacked bar chart, line chart, [seaborn relplot](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.relplot.html), etc. Recreating some of the graphics that 538 uses would be a lot easier in Adobe photoshop/illustrator than with matplotlib. 
# 
# - If you put in some time to find a graph that looks "easy" to replicate you'll probably find that it's not as easy as you thought. 
# 
# - If you start with a graph that looks hard to replicate you'll probably run up against a brick wall and be disappointed with your afternoon.

# # STRETCH OPTIONS
# 
# ### 1) Reproduce one of the following using the matplotlib or seaborn libraries:
# 
# - [thanksgiving-2015](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-what-your-part-of-america-eats-on-thanksgiving/) 
# - [candy-power-ranking](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking/) 
# - or another example of your choice!
# 
# ### 2) Make more charts!
# 
# Choose a chart you want to make, from [Visual Vocabulary - Vega Edition](http://ft.com/vocabulary).
# 
# Find the chart in an example gallery of a Python data visualization library:
# - [Seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html)
# - [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html)
# - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/gallery.html)
# - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html)
# 
# Reproduce the chart. [Optionally, try the "Ben Franklin Method."](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ubOw9B3Hfip27hF2ZFnW3a3z9xAgrUDRReOEo-FHCVs/edit) If you want, experiment and make changes.
# 
# Take notes. Consider sharing your work with your cohort!
