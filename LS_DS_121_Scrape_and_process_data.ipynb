When we package the application for the end users, many times we package them using a operating system based package manager and ask the users to install using those (say RPM or Debian&#39;s deb package). In the second case, all the dependencies come as separate packages (and most of the time from the OS itself). The dependency is being handled by the OS package manager itself. That case, we can not update the dependencies fast enough if required, it depends on the packagers from the community who maintains those said packages in the distribution.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe use [dh-virtualenv](https://dh-virtualenv.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/) project to help us to use our own wheels + a virtualenv for the project to be packaged inside the debian .deb package.\\r\\nThis talk will go throuh [the process](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client) of building wheels from known (based on sha256sum) source tarballs, and then having a gpg signed list of updated wheels and [a private index](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-debian-packaging/tree/master/simple) for the same.

CPU performance is plateauing, but GPUs provide a chance for continued hardware performance gains, if you can structure your programs to make good use of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nCUDA is a platform developed by Nvidia for GPGPU--general purpose computing with GPUs. It backs some of the most popular deep learning libraries, like Tensorflow and Pytorch, but has broader uses in data analysis, data science, and machine learning. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several ways that you can start taking advantage of CUDA in your Python programs. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor some common Python libraries, there are drop-in replacements that let you start running computations on the GPU while still using familiar APIs. For example, CuPy provides a NumPy-like API for interacting with multi-dimensional arrays. Similarly, cuDF is a recent project that mimics the pandas interface for dataframes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want more control over your use of CUDA APIs, you can use the PyCUDA library, which provides bindings for the CUDA API that you can call from your Python code. Compared with drop-in libraries, it gives you the ability to manually allocate memory on the GPU, and write custom CUDA functions (called kernels). However, its drawbacks include writing your CUDA code as large strings in Python, and compiling your CUDA code at runtime.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, for the best performance you can use the Python C/C++ extension interface, the approach taken by deep learning libraries like Pytorch. One of the strengths of Python is the ability to drop down into C/C++, and libraries like NumPy take advantage of this for increased speed. If you use Nvidia’s nvcc compiler for CUDA, you can use the same extension interface to write custom CUDA kernels, and then call them from your Python code.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis talk will explore each of these methods, provide examples to get started, and discuss in more detail the pros and cons of each approach. </div>\\n  \\n    <h2>\\n      <a id=\"presentation-184\"\\n         href=\"/2019/schedule/presentation/184/\">\\n        Dependency hell: a library author&#39;s guide\\n      </a>\\n    </h2>\\n    <p>\\n      <b>\\n        Yanhui Li, Brian Quinlan\\n        \\n      </b>\\n      \\n      <br>\\n      <b>\\n        Saturday\\n        11:30 a.m.&ndash;noon\\n        in\\n        Grand Ballroom B\\n      </b>\\n      \\n    </p>\\n    <div class=\"presentation-description\"\\n         >Python is known for its &quot;batteries included&quot; philosophy but no Python developer can live without the language&#39;s rich library ecosystem.

Set operations enable simpler and faster solutions for many tasks;\\r\\n1. Python&#39;s set classes are lessons in elegant, idiomatic API design;\\r\\n1. A set class is a suitable context for implementing operator overloading.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoolean logic and set theory are closely related. In practice, we will see cases where set operations provide simple and fast declarative solutions to programming problems that otherwise require complicated and slow procedural coding.\\r\\n\\r\\nPython&#39;s set built-ins and ABCs provide a rich and well designed API. We will consider their interfaces, and how they can inspire the creation of Pythonic APIs for your own classes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, we will discuss operator overloading — a technique that is not suitable everywhere, but certainly makes sense with sets. Taking a few operators as examples, we will study their implementation in a new `UintSet` class for integer elements. `UintSet` fully implements the `MutableSet` interface over a totally different internal representation based on a bit array instead of a hash table. Membership tests run in _O(1)_ time like the built-in sets (however, `UintSet` is currently pure Python, so YMMV). Using bit arrays allow core set operations like intersection and union to be implemented with fast bitwise operators, and provides compact storage for dense sets of integers.\\r\\n</div>\\n  \\n    <h2>\\n      <a id=\"presentation-197\"\\n         href=\"/2019/schedule/presentation/197/\">\\n        Statistical Profiling (and other fun with the sys module)\\n      </a>\\n    </h2>\\n    <p>\\n      <b>\\n        Emin Martinian\\n        \\n      </b>\\n      \\n      <br>\\n      <b>\\n        Saturday\\n        2:35 p.m.&ndash;3:05 p.m.\\n        in\\n        Atrium Ballroom AB\\n      </b>\\n      \\n    </p>\\n    <div class=\"presentation-description\"\\n         >Profiling involves computing a set of data about how often and how\\r\\nlong various parts of your program are executed.

This means that modifying the behavior of a superclass might alter the behavior of all its subclasses, sometimes in unanticipated ways. Furthermore, it’s commonly accepted that inheritance actually breaks encapsulation. So, if inheritance has these issues, what alternative do we have? More than two decades ago, The Gang of Four (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides) suggested in their famous _Design Patterns_ book  that we should favor object composition over class inheritance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this talk I will show some code examples in Python where inheritance goes astray and demonstrate how to correct them by using composition.

Using `dateutil` and `pytz` as examples, this talk covers how to deal with ambiguous and imaginary times, datetime arithmetic around a Daylight Savings Time transition, and datetime&#39;s new `fold` attribute, introduced in Python 3.6 ([PEP 495](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0495/)).\\r\\n</div>\\n  \\n  \\n</div>\\n                  \\n                </div>\\n              </div>\\n            </div>\\n            \\n          </div>\\n        \\n    </div>\\n  \\n</div>\\n<footer>\\n  <div class=\"footer-container\">\\n    <img class=\"python-logo\" src=\"/2019/site_media/static/img/psf-logo.3411e5f40050.png\"\\n         width=300 alt=\"PSF logo\">\\n    \\n    <p>\\n      The PyCon 2019 conference in Cleveland, Ohio, USA, is a production of the\\n      <a href=\"http://python.org/psf/\">Python Software Foundation</a>.\\n      This site is built using\\n      <a href=\"https://www.djangoproject.com/\">Django</a>\\n      and\\n      <a href=\"http://eldarion.com/symposion/\" title=\"Symposion — An Open Platform for Conference Websites\">Symposion</a>.\\n      Hosting is provided by\\n      <a href=\"http://heroku.com/\">Heroku</a>.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n      Logo and Branding by\\n      <a href=\"http://hellofizz.com/\"><img title=\"Fizz Creative\" alt=\"Fizz Creative\" src=\"/2019/site_media/static/img/fizz.b1afc5c95fa1.png\"/></a>.\\n    </p>\\n  </div>\\n</footer>\\n\\n\\n\\n</body>\\n</html>\\n'"

And depending on the users, it can be installed on thousands on computers or on a selected few systems. https://pypi.org is our goto place for finding any dependencies and also in most of the time we install binary wheels directly\\r\\nfrom there, thus saving a lot time. But, Python is also being used in many environments where security is the utter most important, and validating the dependencies of project is also very critical along with the actual project source code.  Many of noticed the recent incident where people were being able to [steal bticoins using a popular library](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/11/26/npm_repo_bitcoin_stealer/).This talk will take [SecureDrop client application](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client) for journalists as an example project and see how we tried to tackle the similar problem. SecureDrop is an Open Source whistleblower system which is deployed over 75 news organizations all over the world. Our threat model has nation state actors as possible threats, so, security and privacy of the users of the system is a very important point of the whole project. The tools in this case are build and packaged into reproducible Debian deb packages and are installed on Qubes OS in the final end user systems. There are two basic ways we handle Python project dependencies, for most of the development work, we use a virtualenv, and directly install the dependencies using wheels built from pypi.org. When we package the application for the end users, many times we package them using a operating system based package manager and ask the users to install using those (say RPM or Debian's deb package). In the second case, all the dependencies come as separate packages (and most of the time from the OS itself). The dependency is being handled by the OS package manager itself. That case, we can not update the dependencies fast enough if required, it depends on the packagers from the community who maintains those said packages in the distribution. We use [dh-virtualenv](https://dh-virtualenv.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/) project to help us to use our own wheels + a virtualenv for the project to be packaged inside the debian .deb package.\\r\\nThis talk will go throuh [the process](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client) of building wheels from known (based on sha256sum) source tarballs, and then having a gpg signed list of updated wheels and [a private index](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-debian-packaging/tree/master/simple) for the same. And also how we are verifying the wheels' sha256sum (and the signature of that list) during the build process.

However, early converts are often disappointed to find that the admin doesn't seem to be scaling as their database grows in size, forcing them (so they think) to switch to a custom interface much sooner than they would prefer. However, many common performance issues can be fixed with a few small configuration changes that are much easier than a rewrite! In this talk, we'll use an example project to demonstrate the most common performance pitfalls encountered when using the Django admin, and fix them - live!

CPU performance is plateauing, but GPUs provide a chance for continued hardware performance gains, if you can structure your programs to make good use of them. CUDA is a platform developed by Nvidia for GPGPU--general purpose computing with GPUs. It backs some of the most popular deep learning libraries, like Tensorflow and Pytorch, but has broader uses in data analysis, data science, and machine learning.  There are several ways that you can start taking advantage of CUDA in your Python programs.  For some common Python libraries, there are drop-in replacements that let you start running computations on the GPU while still using familiar APIs. For example, CuPy provides a NumPy-like API for interacting with multi-dimensional arrays. Similarly, cuDF is a recent project that mimics the pandas interface for dataframes. If you want more control over your use of CUDA APIs, you can use the PyCUDA library, which provides bindings for the CUDA API that you can call from your Python code. Compared with drop-in libraries, it gives you the ability to manually allocate memory on the GPU, and write custom CUDA functions (called kernels). However, its drawbacks include writing your CUDA code as large strings in Python, and compiling your CUDA code at runtime. Finally, for the best performance you can use the Python C/C++ extension interface, the approach taken by deep learning libraries like Pytorch. One of the strengths of Python is the ability to drop down into C/C++, and libraries like NumPy take advantage of this for increased speed. If you use Nvidia’s nvcc compiler for CUDA, you can use the same extension interface to write custom CUDA kernels, and then call them from your Python code. This talk will explore each of these methods, provide examples to get started, and discuss in more detail the pros and cons of each approach.', 'Python is known for its \"batteries included\" philosophy but no Python developer can live without the language\\'s rich library ecosystem. Unfortunately, as the number of libraries increases, so does the risk of cross-library incompatibilities, or \"dependency hell\".

Developers who use mocks and patches without doing TDD or OOD are susceptible to falling into many well-understood and documented traps. This talk will draw a historical connection between the way mocks are taught today, and their origins in TDD, OOD, and Java.  It will also demonstrate some pitfalls, and provide some guidance and alternatives to mocking and patching (e.g., dependency injection, test doubles, functional style).', 'Every programmer should learn to use solvers, tools that reason directly from a description of a problem to its solution.   Tools like AlphaZero can formulate winning strategies for games given only a description of the rules of the game.  For certain classes of problems, we really can just let the computer do the work. In this talk, we learn principles, techniques, and multiple examples for three solvers available in Python. The first tool is a generic puzzle-solving framework that employs tree search strategies.  We apply it to a simple sequencing problem and then to a harder sliding-block puzzle. Next, we\\'ll look at the solver code to learn how it works.  I\\'ll also show an essential optimization technique and how to humanize the output.  We demonstrate our skills by solving another famous puzzle. The second tool is called a SAT solver. It is one of the miracles of the 21st century. From first principles, I\\'ll show you what problems it solves and the way problems need to be described for modules like *PycoSAT*.  I\\'ll provide helper functions to humanize our interactions with this great tool.  Then, we\\'ll demonstrate our skills by creating a Sudoku solver and a readable logic problem solver. The third tool is the \"multi-armed bandit\". It is a generic reinforcement learning algorithm that is easy to learn, powerful, and applicable to a broad class of problems.  We apply it to winning rock-paper-scissors using pattern recognition. Lastly, I\\'ll summarize DeepMind\\'s paper on AlphaZero which was published in the December 2018 edition of *Science*.  This gives us hints at the full potential of these techniques.   Pure Python source code and examples are provided for all of the tools.', \"&lt;announcer> This one quick trick will help you measure the diversity of your hiring pipeline!  Read on to hear how! &lt;/announcer> One challenge in improving diversity within a hiring pipeline is the struggle to measure what exists in the first place. It's hard to know where to focus your resources until you know what you have to work with, and can identify what steps make a difference and what efforts don't. Using python/django and an api key for our recruiting vendor, you can make this information visible and, therefore, actionable, with very little work.\", \"Maps are powerful tools that we use every day. Python is well-equipped to handle spatial data and with well documented robust libraries to help you perform spatial analysis and create beautiful maps. In this talk, we'll discover the fascinating world of spatial analysis by solving a fun problem: where can we go to see an upcoming solar eclipse? Along the way we'll learn about mapping topics like projections and coordinate systems, best practices for map making, and intricacies of spatial data.\", \"Python is a flexible language. Your Python app, on the other hand, is usually more set in stone: buttons, functions, displays are all explicitly defined. In this talk you'll learn how to take advantage of features like decorators and functions as first-class objects to set up a simple plugin system that allows your app to be more flexible. In fact, you can allow your users to add or customize functionality they want after you ship. By using plugins, your code becomes more modular and maintainable. At the same time your users may be able to use your great app to work with data or challenges you didn't even know existed.\", 'Digital Signal Processing and Player Piano don\\'t normally come together in the same sentance. Player Pianos that are 100+ years old are awesome artisan artifacts, but they don\\'t play digital formats very well. This talk will show how we take a 100+ year old technology and marry it to the digital age via Python libraries and precision lasers!  In this discussion we will cover how we are creating our own \"Plug-n-Stream Player Piano\". We will take a look at the different digital signal processing Python libraries, their functionality, and requirements for converting audio streams to piano playable audio files. After a brief walk through of our prototyped hardware, we will dissect the digital signal processing, converting streaming music to data for the Player Piano. With a real Player Piano in the room we will demo streaming music from our devices onto the piano.  LIVE(ish) Piano Playing!', \"Decorators are one of Python's most powerful features.  But even if you understand what they do, it's not always obvious what you can do with them.  Sure, from a practical perspective, they let you remove repeated code from your callables.  And semantically, they let you think at a higher level of abstraction, applying the same treatment to functions and classes. But what can you actually do with them?  For many Python developers I've encountered, ecorators sometimes appear to be a solution looking for a problem. In this talk, I'll show you some practical uses for decorators, and how you can use them to make your code more readable and maintainable, while also providing more semantic power.  Moreover, you'll see examples of things would be hard to do without decorators.  I hope that after this talk, you'll have a good sense of how to use decorators in your own Python projects.\", \"Notebooks have traditionally been a tool for drafting code and avoiding repeated expensive computations while exploring solutions. However, with new tools like nteract's papermill and scrapbook libraries, this technology has been expanded to make a reusable and parameterizable template for execution. We'll walk though how Jupyter notebooks are being programmatically used at Netflix and how this helps with our batch processing world. We'll also explore how these use cases connect back with users and why we've adopted these tools for Python and non-Python execution.\", 'The deep learning hype is real, and the Python ecosystem makes it easier than ever to neural networks to everything from speech recognition to generating memes. But when picking a model architecture to apply to your work, you should consider more than just state of the art results from NeurIPS. The amount of time, money and data available to you are equally, if not more, important. This talk will cover some alternatives to deep learning, including regression, tree-based methods and distance based methods. More importantly, it will include a frank discussion of the pros and cons of different methods and when it makes sense to use each in practice.', \"Packages that won't install, encodings that don't work, installers that ask too many questions, and having to own a PC are all great reasons to just ignore Windows. Or they would be, if they were true. Despite community perception, more than half of Python usage is on Windows, including web development, system administration, and data science, just like on Linux and Mac. And for the most part, Python works the same regardless of what operating system you happen to be using. Still, many library developers will unnecessarily exclude half of their potential audience by not even attempting to be compatible. This session will walk through the things to be aware of when creating cross-platform libraries. From simple things like using `pathlib` rather than `bytes`, through to all the ways you can get builds and tests running on Windows for free, by the end of this session you will have a checklist of easy tasks for your project that will really enable the whole Python world to benefit from your work.\", \"While high-level security concepts may transcend languages, each language has its own sets of tools and edge cases that are worth knowing.  Python is one of many popular languages that is rarely the focus in security training, but that doesn't mean python code is automatically secure (no matter what the internet tells you).  Learn why people who say “pylint will help you with security” aren’t doing you any favours, how to use Bandit for security-focused linting and talk about other options for static analysis.  Take a deeper look at why scanning for publicly known vulnerabilities is complicated, and how to use Pyup Safety to make it easier.  We’ll also explore some language myths and best practices.\", \"Being able to release rapidly and continuously allows businesses to react to opportunities, shorten feedback loop for product iteration cycle and reduce debug effort for erroneous changes.

Over 483 people died due to the flooding caused by the opening of dams and a million people were evacuated.  I started a website ([keralarescue.in][1]), written in Django. The main purpose of the site was effective collaboration and communication between authorities, volunteers and public. The site was open source from Day 0. About 1500 developers and volunteers onboard our slack group in a couple of days. Within a week, the community united to forge a critical piece of software that saved thousands of lives. The site initiated as a portal for refugees to request essential resources like food and water and for volunteers to see their needs, all sorted by geographical location. Additionally, we provided direct information for the government and became the official website later on. The Minimum Viable Product was delivered in fourteen hours. In the initial days, it was only used by the volunteers and Point of Contacts assigned by the government. Later, when the situation became critical, we started getting rescue requests from stranded refugees. The Github repo of the website went viral, and we started to receive feature requests rapidly. We received more than five hundred pull requests in the span of three weeks.  The story I want to present is about the community and technical aspects of keralarescue.in, how people from different backgrounds came together to build a critical piece of software that saved many lives.

So I did what any defiant engineer would. I signed up for a free AWS account and began (responsibly) scraping millions of their unauthenticated Pokemon battles. We'll journey together through this passion project of mine and draw on specific examples to better understand the trade-offs of working with distributed systems or microservice architectures in the cloud.\", \"Key takeaways: 1. Set operations enable simpler and faster solutions for many tasks;\\r\\n1. Python's set classes are lessons in elegant, idiomatic API design;\\r\\n1. A set class is a suitable context for implementing operator overloading. Boolean logic and set theory are closely related. In practice, we will see cases where set operations provide simple and fast declarative solutions to programming problems that otherwise require complicated and slow procedural coding. Python's set built-ins and ABCs provide a rich and well designed API. We will consider their interfaces, and how they can inspire the creation of Pythonic APIs for your own classes. Finally, we will discuss operator overloading — a technique that is not suitable everywhere, but certainly makes sense with sets. Taking a few operators as examples, we will study their implementation in a new `UintSet` class for integer elements. `UintSet` fully implements the `MutableSet` interface over a totally different internal representation based on a bit array instead of a hash table. Membership tests run in _O(1)_ time like the built-in sets (however, `UintSet` is currently pure Python, so YMMV). Using bit arrays allow core set operations like intersection and union to be implemented with fast bitwise operators, and provides compact storage for dense sets of integers.\", \"Profiling involves computing a set of data about how often and how\\r\\nlong various parts of your program are executed. Profiling is useful\\r\\nto understand what makes your program slow and how you can improve\\r\\nit. After a quick review of deterministic profiling tools and\\r\\ntechniques, I will describe how you can do statistical profiling with\\r\\nexisting packages or write your own from scratch. Statistical profiling involves occasionally sampling what your program\\r\\nis doing instead of watching each line or function. A key feature of\\r\\nstatistical profiling is that by using a moderate sampling frequency,\\r\\nyou can profile your production code with almost no overhead. This lets\\r\\nyou find the actual bottlenecks in real use cases. The core technical focus of the talk is python's sys module and how it\\r\\nlets you easily examine a running program. I also describe some tricks\\r\\nto be aware of related to threading, context switches, locks, and so on.\\r\\nAt the conclusion of the talk, you will hopefully understand how to use\\r\\nan existing statistical profiler or write a customized version yourself.\", 'Testing code is important. Testing, primarily unit-testing async code\\r\\nrequires heading off the the standard roadway of unit testing in python.

This talk explores using Python to take raw terrain data - from aerial lidar and space-based radar scans - and processing it into 3D models, and CAD/CAM toolpaths, with the ultimate result of making Python-powered artwork of some of Earth's natural wonders. See how to reduce each National Park to a small, intricately-milled metal carving, how to laser-cut a side-on relief of a whole Hawaiian island, or how to 3D print tiny versions of cities where you can make out each individual building - and the strengths and challenges of using Python to handle 3D and GIS data. We'll also look at some basic 3D modelling code, discuss the wonders of different map projections, and how personal LiDAR is slowly, but surely, becoming affordable.\", 'If you’ve ever `pip install`ed a Python package with C extensions on Linux, it was probably a painful experience, having to download and install development headers for libraries you’ve never even heard of. Maybe you’ve given up on pip and have switched to Conda. But it doesn’t have to be this way! The Python Packaging Authority has been working hard to solve this problem with a new distribution format for compiled Python code, called “wheels.” In this talk, we’ll descend into the practice of PEPs 513 and 571: arcane scrolls that can equip Python developers with spells to pre-compile applications and libraries in a way that allows most Linux end users to run them directly. I’ll show you how to hex compiled artifacts and source code into the wheel format, harness application binary interfaces (ABIs) to use external libraries, brave the eldritch horrors of the dynamic linker, and bind these all together in the manylinux environment. Come learn to harness the black magic of Python wheels, and you too can spare your users pain… for a price.', 'Inheritance is among the first concepts we learn when studying object-oriented programming. But inheritance comes with some unhappy strings attached. Inheritance, by its very nature, tends to bind a subclass to its superclass. This means that modifying the behavior of a superclass might alter the behavior of all its subclasses, sometimes in unanticipated ways. Furthermore, it’s commonly accepted that inheritance actually breaks encapsulation. So, if inheritance has these issues, what alternative do we have? More than two decades ago, The Gang of Four (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides) suggested in their famous _Design Patterns_ book  that we should favor object composition over class inheritance. In this talk I will show some code examples in Python where inheritance goes astray and demonstrate how to correct them by using composition. My intention is not to demonize inheritance, but instead present how to use it wisely in order to improve the design of our object-oriented software so that it’s more flexible and easier to maintain.', 'Many developers struggle to find the balance between striving to improve existing code and letting good enough alone by accepting certain shortcomings. As a new developer to a team it can be difficult to understand existing strategies and patterns that are sometimes flat out bad (and often openly acknowledged as such). Often the result of tight deadlines or unclear specifications, even the best developers write code they later look back upon with shudders. So how do we decide when refactoring is worth it? Come learn strategies for refactoring with minimal impact, methods for working with bad code you can’t change, and strategies for knowing the difference between what is fixable and what is better left alone.', 'The Zen of Python, accessed by running `import this`, is a list of nineteen aphorisms that have guided the development of the language. It has good advice for how to organize our code, but what does it have to say about how we organize ourselves? Plenty: the Zen of Python is not only a solid set of development principles, but the other easter egg is that it’s packed with wisdom about how to build healthy teams.  In this talk I draw upon my time as an engineering manager of Python-focused engineering teams to tell stories of what the Zen of Python has to teach us about communication and conflict, building inclusive teams and transparent processes, and promoting psychological safety. Come ready to reflect on and feel inspired by a new interpretation of these principles, and bring what you learn back to your meetup, study group, open source project, or team.', \"If you haven't tried multiprocessing or you are trying to move beyond `multiprocessing.map()`, you will likely find that using Python's `multiprocessing` module can get quite intricate and convoluted.

We used Python to create the definitions, configuration files, and supplementary metadata for each of the weather radars we worked with.  We used a variety of custom tools to interface with existing systems and processes that would have been infeasible to work with otherwise. We took advantage of one of Python’s greatest strengths: its flexibility.  We used it to perform the bulk of our data processing with NumPy, created custom utility functions to encourage code reuse, and created custom scripts for interfacing with the institutional data processing framework we worked within.', \"Using the pandas python library requires a shift in thinking that is not always intuitive to those who use it. This talk will take a deep dive into the underlying data structure of pandas to explain why it performs the way it does under certain circumstances. It will explain why a MultiIndex DataFrame takes up less memory than it's simple counter part, why groupby should never be run on a non-MultiIndexed DataFrame, why the example documentation for the pandas apply function is an example of how not to use it, and how not taking the time to normalize data can affect performance.\", 'Having libraries in your Python project properly locked to a specific version is a well known best practice.

How these recommendations look like? How are different observations like performance characteristics of machine learning libraries for a particular hardware gathered?', 'One of the reasons why programming in Python is very straightforward and simple is that we do not have to worry about the lifetime of our objects. That is, once it ceases to be necessary, a variable disappears from the memory \"magically\". The fact that this happens automatically can erroneously lead us to believe that it is not required to worry about what happens behind the scenes. Nothing is further from reality: knowing how Python manages memory is fundamental in specific scenarios, and not knowing what is happening can have consequences as significant as unpleasant. For example, if our programs manage a large amount of data at the same time or launch multiple processes in parallel, this ceases to be a theoretical issue and becomes something that we, logical minds, also care. Although these concepts tend to be considered advanced and difficult to understand, we will see that this is not the case. This topic is not a purely theoretical matter nor is it difficult to find its practical applications. In this talk, we will explain why it is something that should matter to us, and we will talk about how to apply the knowledge we have gained to specific problems.', \"Why come to yet another talk about CPython's GIL? [1]  Sure, we'll spend a little time on what it is, who it affects (and doesn't), and how to work around it.  However, what you want to come hear is what the future holds for the GIL. We'll take most of the time talking about life *after* the GIL!  Come see what recent developments and ongoing work will allow us to either circumvent the GIL and get rid of it, unlocking true multi-core capability in Python code.

Since then, variable annotations (plus, more recently, protocols) improved its capabilities even further. Over the last two years, tools, such as mypy, could build on top of it. Slowly, these annotations have emerged from a proof of concept state (e.g., mypy API planning) to becoming a stable feature. In this presentation, I'll tell my story of using type hints for both adding type hinting and checking type correctness for a library supporting both Python 2 and 3 and reusing this information to insert type data into the generated Sphinx documentation automatically.\", 'Knowing your enemies is as important as knowing your friends.
