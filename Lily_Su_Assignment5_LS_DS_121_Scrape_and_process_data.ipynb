When we package the application for the end users, many times we package them using a operating system based package manager and ask the users to install using those (say RPM or Debian's deb package). In the second case, all the dependencies come as separate packages (and most of the time from the OS itself). The dependency is being handled by the OS package manager itself. That case, we can not update the dependencies fast enough if required, it depends on the packagers from the community who maintains those said packages in the distribution.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe use [dh-virtualenv](https://dh-virtualenv.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/) project to help us to use our own wheels + a virtualenv for the project to be packaged inside the debian .deb package.\\r\\nThis talk will go throuh [the process](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client) of building wheels from known (based on sha256sum) source tarballs, and then having a gpg signed list of updated wheels and [a private index](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-debian-packaging/tree/master/simple) for the same.

              " 'It’s 2019, and Moore’s Law is dead. CPU performance is plateauing, but GPUs provide a chance for continued hardware performance gains, if you can structure your programs to make good use of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nCUDA is a platform developed by Nvidia for GPGPU--general purpose computing with GPUs. It backs some of the most popular deep learning libraries, like Tensorflow and Pytorch, but has broader uses in data analysis, data science, and machine learning. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several ways that you can start taking advantage of CUDA in your Python programs. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor some common Python libraries, there are drop-in replacements that let you start running computations on the GPU while still using familiar APIs. For example, CuPy provides a NumPy-like API for interacting with multi-dimensional arrays. Similarly, cuDF is a recent project that mimics the pandas interface for dataframes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want more control over your use of CUDA APIs, you can use the PyCUDA library, which provides bindings for the CUDA API that you can call from your Python code. Compared with drop-in libraries, it gives you the ability to manually allocate memory on the GPU, and write custom CUDA functions (called kernels). However, its drawbacks include writing your CUDA code as large strings in Python, and compiling your CUDA code at runtime.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, for the best performance you can use the Python C/C++ extension interface, the approach taken by deep learning libraries like Pytorch. One of the strengths of Python is the ability to drop down into C/C++, and libraries like NumPy take advantage of this for increased speed. If you use Nvidia’s nvcc compiler for CUDA, you can use the same extension interface to write custom CUDA kernels, and then call them from your Python code.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis talk will explore each of these methods, provide examples to get started, and discuss in more detail the pros and cons of each approach.',\n",

For certain classes of problems, we really can just let the computer do the work.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this talk, we learn principles, techniques, and multiple examples for three solvers available in Python.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first tool is a generic puzzle-solving framework that employs tree search strategies.  We apply it to a simple sequencing problem and then to a harder sliding-block puzzle. Next, we\\'ll look at the solver code to learn how it works.  I\\'ll also show an essential optimization technique and how to humanize the output.  We demonstrate our skills by solving another famous puzzle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second tool is called a SAT solver. It is one of the miracles of the 21st century. From first principles, I\\'ll show you what problems it solves and the way problems need to be described for modules like *PycoSAT*.  I\\'ll provide helper functions to humanize our interactions with this great tool.  Then, we\\'ll demonstrate our skills by creating a Sudoku solver and a readable logic problem solver.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third tool is the \"multi-armed bandit\". It is a generic reinforcement learning algorithm that is easy to learn, powerful, and applicable to a broad class of problems.  We apply it to winning rock-paper-scissors using pattern recognition.\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, I\\'ll summarize DeepMind\\'s paper on AlphaZero which was published in the December 2018 edition of *Science*.

We will consider their interfaces, and how they can inspire the creation of Pythonic APIs for your own classes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, we will discuss operator overloading — a technique that is not suitable everywhere, but certainly makes sense with sets. Taking a few operators as examples, we will study their implementation in a new `UintSet` class for integer elements. `UintSet` fully implements the `MutableSet` interface over a totally different internal representation based on a bit array instead of a hash table. Membership tests run in _O(1)_ time like the built-in sets (however, `UintSet` is currently pure Python, so YMMV). Using bit arrays allow core set operations like intersection and union to be implemented with fast bitwise operators, and provides compact storage for dense sets of integers.\",\n",

            "There are two basic ways we handle Python project dependencies, for most of the development work, we use a virtualenv, and directly install the dependencies using wheels built from pypi.org. When we package the application for the end users, many times we package them using a operating system based package manager and ask the users to install using those (say RPM or Debian's deb package). In the second case, all the dependencies come as separate packages (and most of the time from the OS itself). The dependency is being handled by the OS package manager itself. That case, we can not update the dependencies fast enough if required, it depends on the packagers from the community who maintains those said packages in the distribution.\r\n",

            "This talk will go throuh [the process](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client) of building wheels from known (based on sha256sum) source tarballs, and then having a gpg signed list of updated wheels and [a private index](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-debian-packaging/tree/master/simple) for the same. And also how we are verifying the wheels' sha256sum (and the signature of that list) during the build process.  The final output is reproducible Debian packages.\n"

Many of noticed the recent incident where people were being able to [steal bticoins using a popular library](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/11/26/npm_repo_bitcoin_stealer/).This talk will take [SecureDrop client application](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client) for journalists as an example project and see how we tried to tackle the similar problem. SecureDrop is an Open Source whistleblower system which is deployed over 75 news organizations all over the world. Our threat model has nation state actors as possible threats, so, security and privacy of the users of the system is a very important point of the whole project. The tools in this case are build and packaged into reproducible Debian deb packages and are installed on Qubes OS in the final end user systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two basic ways we handle Python project dependencies, for most of the development work, we use a virtualenv, and directly install the dependencies using wheels built from pypi.org. When we package the application for the end users, many times we package them using a operating system based package manager and ask the users to install using those (say RPM or Debian's deb package). In the second case, all the dependencies come as separate packages (and most of the time from the OS itself). The dependency is being handled by the OS package manager itself. That case, we can not update the dependencies fast enough if required, it depends on the packagers from the community who maintains those said packages in the distribution.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe use [dh-virtualenv](https://dh-virtualenv.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/) project to help us to use our own wheels + a virtualenv for the project to be packaged inside the debian .deb package.\\r\\nThis talk will go throuh [the process](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-client) of building wheels from known (based on sha256sum) source tarballs, and then having a gpg signed list of updated wheels and [a private index](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-debian-packaging/tree/master/simple) for the same. And also how we are verifying the wheels' sha256sum (and the signature of that list) during the build process.  The final output is reproducible Debian packages.\"]"
